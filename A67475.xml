            <title>A view of fundamental principles first in general and then in particular. Divided into three parts. The first part, containing a general view of the common nature of fundamentals of religion, handling many difficult questions about them, and pointing (in the conclusion) to a sufficient and particular catalogue of twelve great principles, the subject of both the other parts. The second part, beginning a particular view of fundamentals, with a discourse of the six first principles, out of six several texts of Scripture. The third part, continuing, and concluding, the said particular view, with a discourse of the six last principles, out of one eminent text, viz. Heb. 6. 1, 2.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Whatever God does in the world he mindes himself in it. When ever he displaies his attributes, he'l have them reflect their glory upon himself. God never has an end without himself; tis
<pb facs="tcp:30732:5"/> never terminated upon any of the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he must have an end suitable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self who is infinite, which cannot be found amongst the creature. And because God would not exact from man, what he had not given him power to execute (nothing being able to act higher than the principles of its being will suffer it) he wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which did become a creature of that noble rank that God had placed him in; he understood the natures of things as they were in themselves, there was no falling out between the understanding and the will, but a perfect concord, and agreement with one another. He knew how to value those things, that had the Image and Impress of God upon them, his affections were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at the command of those objects that did justly challenge veneration. He had sences fully exercised to discerne between things that differed. As he knew God to be infinite in all perfection, So he understood no other happiness, than to be like him, and to have Communion with him. But alas, how is the gold become dross, and the fine gold changed, he's now quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than what he was at first, you cannot know him by this description I have given you of him; There is now scarce any truth in his understanding;
<pb facs="tcp:30732:5"/> the things without him bare proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they have no answerablenesse to the conceptions he has of them in his mind, and therefore if at all, he serves God carelessely, he looks upon the great things of eternity as either matters that do not concern him, or else things that are not worth minding: Nothing is more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary than to see him cheated by the false mises and dresses that sin has nailed it self withal. Really he's imposed upon by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, that presents it self to him with a shew of good; He consents of a sudden, and finds himself impatient of a further enquiry.</p>
                  <p>Now when God works a change in man by the means he has ordained, he returns in part to his first self, he's resolved in part to that penitive purity he had at first; His apprehensions are better suited to the <note place="margin">

                  <p>The Apostle, or Holy-Pen-man of this Epistle, having Attempted the Advancement of Christs Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or Mediator-ship, especially his Priesthood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Levitical Priesthood, and now being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to wade into the deep and difficult Mysteries thereabouts, he meets with a great and almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible impediment or obstruction of his Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enterprise, <hi>viz.</hi> the dulnesse and incapacity of his Readers the Hebrew-Christians: This he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates plainly to them, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>[of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing yee are dull of hearing.]</hi> And we may thank God for their dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in one respect, as it was the happy occasion of this large Parenthesis, from my Text to the end of the next Chapter, wherein we have a summary accompt of the Doctrine of <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a seasonable <hi>Item</hi> against <hi>Apostacy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that <hi>provoking Motive</hi> to perseverance, taken from the Faithfulnesse of God to his promise, and the immutability of his Counsel, in the <hi>6th.</hi> Chapter; in the last Verse of which Chapter, he bears in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to that mysterious point of the Priesthood of Christ, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
                  <p>Note here; The absolute skill of our Heavenly Physician, who is able to bring Light out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and to occasion Doctrine by Dulnesse, for the advantage of the Ages to come, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren yet to be born: So true is that Evangelical saying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>[All things shall work together for good to them that love God,</hi> &amp;c.] But to return to my purpose.</p>

                  <p> My Text is an un-answerable Argument or Proof of the Hebrews Dulness, being taken from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> their Ignorance in First <hi>Principles:</hi> for who is Dull if not he that hath had a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble standing in the Church of God, hath had the advantage of all Ordinances, hath heard much of the Doctrine of Christ, and yet is ignorant of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the main and necessary <hi>Principles</hi> of Religion? and doth not understand the very Catechism, or first grounds of Christianity?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the words of the Text there are two parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. An Exprobation, wherein the Apostle upbraids and chides the Hebrews for their palpable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and markable non-proficiency in Heavenly knowledge.</p>

An Aggravation, wherein he indeavours to dresse their Dull Ignorance in such an odious habit, and such disparaging language, as may justly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it to them, and to all men, a matter of deepest detestation, and absolute hatred, so as to make them nauseate and abominate it for ever.</p>
                  <p>In the former <hi>(viz.</hi> the Exprobation) you have two Branches.</p>

                  <p>In the latter part (the Aggravation) you have three Branches.</p>

Even so you (He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Christians) you have been in Christs College, Christs School thus long, so many years under fruitful ordinances, and are you barten Souls still, ignorant Souls still, Novices still? O what is this but Dulnesse, abhorrid dulnesse, emphatical Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, Sottishnesse to admiration, prodigious Dulnesse (or rather Lazinesse) which wants a name to expresse it! as is hinted in that verse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Text, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>[yee are dull of hearing.]</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:30732:17"/> 1. All must grant, That though the Apostle char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Hebrew-Christians so deeply with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet he doth not mean <hi>all,</hi> but <hi>some of them.</hi> For these Hebrews had several Teachers, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Rulers among them; and surely if they had been so ignorant, he would never have willed the people to obey and submit themselves to such blind guides, <hi>Ch.</hi> 13. 7, 17, 24. And among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Teachers they had <hi>James</hi> an eminent Apostle, and Pillar of the Church for one, as we may read <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It must be likewise granted on all hands, That these ignorant persons were Church-Members, visible Saints, Brethren, holy Brethren, of whom the Apostle had this charitable opinion, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their great ignorance) that they were heirs of Salvation. He calls them brethren, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 12. holy brethren, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and after his sharpest reprehension of them, he still urgeth his charitable thoughts of them, yea more than thoughts, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of their interest in salvation, because their little knowledge carried them out to some practice, in regard of their mercy to the poor, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 9. [But Beloved! <hi>We are perswaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak, &amp;c. For ye have ministred to the Saints.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It must be also granted by all considering men, That though all these Hebrew-Christians, to whom the Epistle is written, were not guilty of such ignorance, yet <hi>many of them</hi> were. For had there been but few among them ignorant, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle would not have spoken so generally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30732:17"/> as if he spake to them all. Most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, if few had been guilty, he would have spoken more <hi>restrainedly,</hi> and with limitation, in such language as might be interpreted to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a far smaller disproportionable part of this Church, and not in Phrase of such latitude, <hi>viz.</hi> ye are dull, ye for the time ought to be Teachers, ye had need be taught again; ye, ye, ye, brethren, holy brethren, of whom I am perswaded things that accompany salvation, (as is above hinted,) words of wide extent. See what restriction and distinguishing language is used in other Epistles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. <hi>[How say</hi> some <hi>among you that there is no resurrection?]</hi> Some among you, not many, but some, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>[There be some that trouble you]</hi> To distinguish them from those many that were not the troublers, but the troubled: But here's no such word of distinction in my Text, which hints the disease to be spreading and Epidemical. Yea &amp; if we narrowly examine the matter, we shall find the generality of Hebrew-Believers, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Jews, to have been very ignorant in main points of Christianity, and to have been <hi>de facto zealous,</hi> superstitiously zealous of the Law of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, <note place="margin">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30732:18"/> this time was an occasion of writing this Epistle to them, for the degrading of the Mosaical Law, and the honourable exaltation of Christ above <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> which is the sum of the Epistle.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It must be yet further granted, That though many of these Hebrew-believers were ignorant of fundamental, yet <hi>not of all fundamentals.</hi> But some were ignorant of one Fundamental, some of another, we must not think they knew no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Christian Religion at all; For how then should they be Christians? How could the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle (without detestable flattery) have hinted to them this his hope and petswasion of their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Scripture denyes mercy to the grossely ignorant of all Fundamentals? <hi>Isay</hi> 27. 11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 8. Yea in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle such ignorance is justly damned to the Gates of Hell, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 10, 11. Besides, it is not likely they were so ignorant of any Fundamentals as some are that never heard of Christ, never enter'd into the Church: Only they did not (clearly) understand some principles, they did not know them with an explicite unfolded knowledge, they did not see plainly into the meaning of them, though they had heard of them, and had been taught the truth. Text <hi>[that one teach you again]</hi> Implying they were taught the Principles before, yet they were comparatively ignorant, ignorant in comparison to their Contemporaries in the Church, in comparison to others of their standing, yea and shamefully ignorant, as is before noted.</p>

                        <p>Now that <hi>Paul</hi> speaks here of Fundamentals is plain, and appears partly from the phrase, Form, or breviate of doctrine, which implies some special Heads; distinct from the whole doctrine of the Gospel; and partly from the consideration of the time when, and the person to whom this was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, which prove it cannot be meant of the whole Scripture. 'Twas delivered before this Epistle was written (for this Epistle minds him of a former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery) and consequently before several Books of the New Testament were written. 'Twas delivered to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who received not the old written Scriptures from <hi>Paul,</hi> but from his Parents▪ who acquainted him with the Scripture from a Child, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. Then it must be a form of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine distinct from the whole Bulk of Scripture, yet collected out of it, some compendious Creed or Catechism, or summary of Fundamentals.</p>
                        <p>This title insinuates three things concerning the nature of Fundamentals.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. They are an Abridgement or Breviate; and so but few in comparison to the multitudes of truths contained in the Scripture. Hence called Elements, with relation to the natural Elements,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30732:22"/> which are but few (as is before hinted) and may be soon numbred, if they were put together in a compendious Creed. Hence the best and most useful Catechisms have been short; the Creed (commonly called the Apostles Creed) short; so the Apostles Catechism or six Principles, short, see <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They are a Form or Pattern; and therefore plain and easie truths; so plain, that a Child may understand them; as plain as the Lords Prayer, and ten Commandements. No such difficulty and obscurity in them, as Papists contend for; fools shall not erre therein, if they have honest hearts set upon the truth, <hi>Isay</hi> 35. 8. Hence those truths that are distinct from fundamentals, are called hard things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>[things hard to be uttered]</hi> that is, hard in comparison to the easier fundamentals. What good would <hi>Moses</hi> pattern have done him, if it had been as difficult as the whole building? <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 9.</p>
                        <p>Hence it follows, that</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They are very useful and necessary to the Church upon all occasions; as the Carpenters Rule to him, as the Writers Coppy to him, as <hi>Moses,</hi> Pattern to him; when <hi>Moses</hi> was at a stand, and could not tell how to go forward with the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, then he might cast his eye upon his Pattern and receive direction immediately, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 5. The sum of this Title is, That Fundamentals are few, plain and necessary.</p>

But I will come to the Scriptural sense of this Title, and shew you in what sense fundamental truths are called a mystery; and the rather, because I have before proved that they are plain and easie truths, which even a Child, a Novice in Religion may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
                        <p>Fundamentals are called a Mystery in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As being secret to nature, and unknown to the wisdom of the world, without particular and divine Revelation. Could reason have suggested the mysterious doctrine of the blessed Trinity, or discourse aright, <hi>(o) de tribus Elohim?</hi> Could <note place="margin">Zanchy.</note> the reason of man have contrived the office of Christ, or imagined his two Natures in personal u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</p>
                        <p>Thus, many truths of the Gospel were as hid
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30732:24"/> Mysteries from the beginning of the world to the fulness of time, because nature, &amp; reason, &amp; learning could not open them to men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25, 26. <hi>[according to the Revelation of the Mystery, which was kept secret since the world began.]</hi> In this sense Fundamentals are a Great Mystery, they are secret to the world, till God please to reveil them; men could not so much as once think of them, without special revelation of the Spirit in the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As being difficult to Faith, not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing when reveiled: as being hard to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and believed when we understand them.</p>
                        <p>When Christ had convinced the understanding of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> about regeneration, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity thereof; yet his faith was wanting, <hi>John</hi> 3. 12. <hi>[and ye believe not] ye receive not our witness,</hi> v. 11.</p>
                        <p>'Tis easie to know what a man meanes, when he speaks of three persons in one essence of God; yet 'tis hard to believe it, and to lay it up in a mans heart; 'tis an exceeding greatness of power which makes us believe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>[who believe according to the working of his mighty Power.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I might instance in the doctrine of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the body, the Doctrine of Christs Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and being born of a Virgin, &amp;c. Things easie to the understanding, but not to the will and affections, not easie to be embraced. In this sense Fundamentals are a Mystery; they are easie to be understood, but hard to be believed; when a man knowes of them, he cannot easily embrace them, because nature cannot give a reason for them.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="24" facs="tcp:30732:25"/> 3. As being comprehensive of many other truths, not fundamental, yet mysterious. All Fundamentals are wide and vast truths, have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more in the breasts of them; yea, one of them may comprehend all the rest, and more than all Fundamentals; as this, <hi>That all Scripture is the Word of God;</hi> and this, <hi>That Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God;</hi> and this, <hi>If thou believest in the Lord Jesus, thou shalt be saved.</hi> These are very comprehensive bottomlesse truths, deep and wide, and large points.</p>
                        <p>Now a Fundamental barely proposed to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is easy to be understood, in the first and genuine sense of it; yet if a man dive to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and search the depth of it, he shall find it an incomprehensible Mystery.</p>
                        <p>But the distinct clear knowledge of the imcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible part of it, is not necessary nor required to fundamental knowledge, <hi>quà</hi> fundamental, and under that strict notion of a first Principle.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. In reference to the nature or essence of things <note place="margin">Whites <hi>defence.</hi>
                           </note> proposed in them. In every Fundamental are two parts, the Essence, and proposition of the thing, the thing it self proposed, and the proposition concerning it. Now the knowledge of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is easy; But knowledge of the thing revealed is difficult, and mysterious. That God is, and that our God is the true God, are easy propositions, Yet the Essence of God, or the thing (God) if I may so speak, is an unsearchable mystery. In like manner, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, is an easy proposition, but the thing (Son-ship) <hi>(viz.</hi> the eternal generation, how he should be begotten of the Father, and yet not after him, nor Inferiour,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30732:25"/> but equal to him) is abstruse and mysterious.</p>
                        <p>So also this proposition, That Christ the Son of God became man, is both God and man, is plain and easy to be understood; Jews and Greeks mock at it, not because they do not understand it, but because they do not believe it; yet the Thing in it <hi>(viz. Christi</hi>

                        <p>Then these be the certain Properties of all Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals: They are first, Large, Sufficient, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; Necessary to the founding of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church.</p>
                        <p>Now that we may improve the Definition, with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30732:32"/> the several properties of First-principles, let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer therefrom these Conclusions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. 'Tis not absolutely necessary every single Member of a Church <hi>(quâ member)</hi> should have as much Fundamental Knowledge as a whole found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church; for were it fo, we should have defined them to be truths necessary (every one of them) to the founding or making of one Believer; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of them every one, no man could be saved, or in the state of Grace: But the definition is otherwise, they are made the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Church, rather than of one Believer; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, That more knowledge is required to the making of a Church of Believers, than is to the making of one Believer. The Roman Church (in its first and happy estate) had her weaklings in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, whom God had received to mercy, and into his favour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1, 4. <hi>[God hath received him that is weak in the faith;]</hi> that is, a new Convert, one weakly grounded in Fundamentals. By the Faith here, he means not the Grace of Faith, nor yet the Act (which yet are comprehended) but the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Faith (as appears by the Context) <hi>viz.</hi> the knowledge of Fundamentals; for would the Apostle call circumstances the Faith? indeed he speaks of Circumstantials afterwards; yet in this Periphasis <hi>[weak in the faith]</hi> he notes the state of the Person whom he would not have troubled with needless disputes, <hi>q. d.</hi> such a one had more need to be better catechised and grounded in the main points of Faith and Christianity, than to be tossed up and down with circumstantial Disputes about Days and Meats, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:30732:32"/> 2. A particular person may in some cases (and especially in this case, when he lives not long after his first conversion, or first act of Faith) be saved without distinct clear single knowledge of every Fundamental. I shewed above how that Apostle call one whom God received, <hi>weak in the Faith:</hi> and I adde, That the Scripture supposeth and yeelds it as granted, that a man may be a Babe in Christ, and yet not know every Fundamental, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12, 13. <hi>[Yee are become such as have need of milk, for every one that useth milk is a babe.]</hi> He likens the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (those among them which were fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally ignorant) to babes, who must be daily fed with the milk of Fundamentals, to preserve the life of grace which is begun in them, by some gli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>mering light of Fundamentals improved by the Spirit of Grace at first conversion. But of this I shall raise a distinct Question, and say more to it when I come at it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We must not judge of the state of particular Believers absolutely and finally, by the intire Body of Fundamentals, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of the visibility of Churches. Though we may conclude a man that hath all Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental knowledge, to have knowledge sufficient to salvation: yet we may not censure him a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less person, or a reprobate, that is ignorant in some particular Fundamental, if he knows others. <hi>Peter</hi> and Christs Disciples were sincere Believers before they knew every fundamental; which I shall refer to the particular Question already mentioned, to be tried in its due place.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. No Church or Society is to be reckoned in the number of Christian visible Churches, where none among them do distinctly know all the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30732:33"/> in some good degree. Every Church-building is fitly framed together on the whole foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, before it grows to an holy Temple, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20, 21. <hi>[The whole building fitly framed together groweth to an holy Temple.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides, every visible Church hath its Teachers in it, Planters, Builders, and they are not fit to be Teachers ordinarily, who have not learned all fundamentals themselves. When the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his expectation of fundamental-knowledge in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he tells them, he <hi>expected they should have been Teachers, Heb.</hi> 5. 12. hinting the unfitness of those to be Teachers, that are to seek in Fundamentals.

                        <p>All the Gospel-Churches recorded in the New Testament had equal-foundation, one had as much foundation as another; and nothing is fundamental, but what every one of them had at first founding. <hi>Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Philippi, Colos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, Thessalonica,</hi> had all one and the same intire foundation, even the same Doctrinal foundation, the same and all the same first Principles, (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shewed:) Though some among them (through the subtilty of seducers might stagger or deny them afterwards, yet they had them at first Plantation. As may further appear by this consideration, That every where the Apostles and Church-founders preached the same Heads of Doctrine when they came to found or plant a Church; and to be sure they could not forget or miss any part of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, when they were in the very Act of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and founding, as any may note in the Acts of the Apostles; and no one whole Church denyed any one of the Fundamentals at first plantation.

                                 <pb n="49" facs="tcp:30732:37"/> Greater and Less, into Absolute and Relative.</item>
                              <item>2. Some Fundamentals are absolutely necessary to be known to Salvation, others of them are not so.</item>
                              <item>3. All Fundamentals are equally necessary to Church-union, and Communion; the knowledge and reception of them all must be in every Church-body. Consequently,</item>
                              <item>4. Some Fundamentals have naturally more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity and aptness to design and effect Salvation than Union: other Fundamentals have more propensity and aptness in them to design and work Union than Salvation: yet All of them (whether Absolute or Relative) do mutually design and effect both Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Union, though some do this, and somo do that, more strongly, vigorously, differently.</item>
                              <item>5. Conclude from hence a Reason of my Definition of Fundamentals; I dare not define them to be Truths absolutely necessary to Salvation; but Truths neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the founding of a Christian Church. The Reason is, because I find this difference among them, some to be absolutely necessary to Salvation, and others not so.

                        <p>1. A man that knows nothing of the Christian Religion (be he Jew or Infidel) may be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by one Sermon, wherein few of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30732:39"/> or possibly but one or two of them are preached; I mean by a Sermon of Faith, or Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or the Passion of Christ, without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Trinity, or Baptism in such Sermon, at least not all the Catalogue of Fundamentals di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly opened. I say, the opening of some one Fundamental in a Sermon, may convert the soul in a moment. That's a notable proof, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 14. 24, 25. <hi>[If there come in one that believeth not, he is convinced, the secrets of his heart are made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, and so falling down on his face, he will worship God,</hi> &amp;c.] 'tis spoken of one that comes in into the Church at a Sermon by accident, with no sound or serious intention. The Eunuch seems to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Sermon of the Passion of Christ, by one Text opened to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 32. <hi>[He was led as a sheep to the slaughter,</hi> &amp;c.] the plain and clear open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Scripture turned him. So <hi>Paul</hi> seems to be converted by one Principle set home upon his conscience, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. <hi>I am Jesus.</hi> The turning Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple was, That Jesus is the Christ. So probably <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> was converted in an instant; and the Thief upon the Cross, by a short Sermon of Christs; you may reade the pithy Sermon which turned him, <hi>Luke</hi> 33. 27, 33. I have read of <hi>Alipius</hi> converted <note place="margin">

Rom.</hi> 13. 13, 14. <hi>Not in riotting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness</hi> &amp;c. This Text po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully applied by the Spirit of God, wrought a wonderfull change in him; and though (no doubt) he had entertained some sound Principles of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge before, which were previous to his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and made way for the happy influence of this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30732:40"/> point upon him, yet it shews us thus much for out purpose, That one Principle set home by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Holy Ghost upon the heart and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a man, is sufficient to change and convert; and this is enough for my purpose: for if a man may be converted without particular explicit knowledge of every Fundamental, then he may be saved without such knowledge, if he live not to know more. <hi>Junius</hi> was converted from Atheism, <note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Tho.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:30732:40"/> may be in Christ, and so a new Creature. Yea here in my Text, he likens those among the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> who did not well know some of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to a Babe unskilfull in the Word of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, not fit for strong meat, but breast-milk al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12, 13. and makes this to be a note of distinction betwixt babes and men in faith, even the exercise of the senses to discern between good and evil. <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. <hi>[Men of full age have their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses exercised to discern between good and evil.)</hi> Still granting, That a Babe may have his senses unexer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, may be unskilfull in the Word of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, may be unable to digest strong meat, may have need to be fed with milk, that is, to be taught the Doctrine of Fundamentals, after conversion, to the end they may learn those Fundamentals after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, which they had not learned before, and eat that milk afterwards, which they had not eaten before. Yea, the Apostle had a charitable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those very <hi>Hebrews</hi> whom he checks for ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in Fundamentals, and tells them, he was perswaded of their salvation, though he thus spake, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 9. And the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> makes it one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a new-born Babe, to desire the Breast-milk of Fundamental-Doctrine after conversion, and so to grow by further knowledge of the milk, not the Meat, but the milk of the Word. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2, 3. He likens the new Convert, that had tasted of God, to a child newly born, who had some milk before 'twas born, and some after; before 'twas born it had Womb-milk; after, the Mothers Milk turns, and so the child feeds upon Breast-milk. So it fares with a Babe in Christ, a new Convert: He had milk, Womb-milk, at or before conversion; Breast-milk
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:30732:41"/> after: The Churches Womb-milk are the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principles; those Principles that had most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the soul, before or at conversion; The Churches Breast-milk are those other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples not known before conversion. Those give life, these growth: <hi>That you may grow thereby,</hi> saith the Apostle.</p>
                        <p>3. There are particular examples of some Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who were <hi>(de facto)</hi> ignorant of some Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals when they were in the state of Grace. <hi>Peter,</hi> with the rest of Christs Disciples, were sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishly <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Potter.</hi>

                        <p>Yet the Doctrine of Christs Death and Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is laid down as a Fundamental in the Creed, <hi>He rose again from the dead;</hi> The Apostles when they went about to found Churches, began with these: See the Acts of the Apostles; yea very great stress is put upon this Doctrine, as if to deny Christs Resurrection, were to deny all resurrection of the Saints, and all faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3, 4, 5, 14. yet there is difference betwixt perverse denying, and simple not knowing. <hi>Philip</hi> had not a clear <note place="margin">Musculus in J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>How far may a man of reason and means be ignorant of Fundamentals, and yet be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? How many must he know, and how many may he not know, if in the state of salvation?</hi>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I answer more generally. If a man know so much as to lead him to Jesus Christ, to trust in him, to love and serve him to the utmost of his understanding, and to desire sincerely to know more of his masters will that he may do it, such a man may be saved though he dye before he know more, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9, 10, 11.</p>

                        <p> 2. I answer more particularly. That one man may be in the state of grace (and consequently saved) ignorant of one principle; another in the state of grace may be ignorant of some other Principle. One that hath grace may not know this Fundamental; another that hath grace may know this, but not that. Men equally gracious, may be differently ignorant, variously and diversly ignorant. <hi>Peter</hi> was ignorant of Christ purpose to dye, and the necessity of his violent death, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>Philio</hi> was ignorant of Christs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, and One-ness with the Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. All the disciples, of the resurrection, for a time, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 10. Many thousand Jews that believed were all zealous of the law, ignorant of free ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification without the law, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 20. and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Galatians</hi> were leavened with the same poysonous Doctrine, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.</p>
                        <p>3. Yet no man capable of means) can be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of that great Principle, which we call, <hi>The Foundation of the Foundation,</hi> and be saved, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 36. <hi>He that believeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> The case of the Jews to this day.</p>
                        <p>4. But how many Fundamentals a man may be ignorant of, and yet gracious, or in the state of salvation, is left doubtfull and uncertain, and (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) not revealed, left men should be idle and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent of all other.</p>

                        <p>Some Papists deny the Distinction of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and Superstructive truths, and frequently urge our Divines to shew them a full Catalogue: whereto our Protestant Writers produce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Creed with its Explanation by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, and withall they prove other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which are not expressed in the Creed, to be <note place="margin">Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines grant the Creed to be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</note> yet plainly couched and comprehended in it: thereby granting that the Creed is a kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Catalogue of Fundamentals, which doth not express <hi>(in terminis)</hi> every Fundamental, but includes them all, in some.</p>

                        <p>Yet the Churches of Christ in all ages have sweetly agreed without such Catalogue.</p>
                        <p>But let me search further for this Catalogue, if it may any where be found.</p>
                        <p n="3">3.

Not one place in the Bible doth set down together such a perfect and definite Catalogue; So as no one more Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle may be added to them out of other places. The fullest Texts which enumerate Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are these, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 23, 24, <hi>&amp;c.

                        <p>The Scripture is far from numbring up the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals to our hand exactly, but leaves them scattered up and down in half Catalogues, here some and there more, willing us to make enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

                        <p>Hence it is that the most excellent Writers have been alwayes cautious in the point of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect enumeration: none that ever I met with durst be very confident.</p>

                        <p>I do not find (as I have said) any Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferring
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30732:60"/> us punctually to this Creed: yet I find St. <hi>Paul</hi> referring <hi>Timothy</hi> to some other, either Creed <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 13.</note> or Catalogue of Fundamentals, or form of sound words. But what is become of that form of sound words? I Answer; Though <hi>Paul</hi> referres us to another Epistle written to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> before that which we call the first to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> yet that Epistle is no where to be found, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <note place="margin">St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Form of words no where to be found.</note> 9. Even so, he referres us to a Catalogue of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals which he delivered to <hi>Timothy,</hi> but that form of words is no where to be found: yet the summe and substance of that Epistle, and this form of words is laid down in other Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> in those half Catalogues and several Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures before mentioned. Here, I will insert a remarkable passage out of our English Divines concerning that Epistle of <hi>Paul</hi> which is lost. <note place="margin">See Anno. on 1 Cor. 5. 9.</note>
                           <q>That Epistle is not now extant, for this is the first to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that is found in the New Testament: and though that Epistle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Divine inspiration, as we may piously conceive that the Books of <hi>Nathan, Gad, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiah, Iddo, Semaiah,</hi> and others, mentioned in the Old Testament, were, which are now though to be lost; yet will it not hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Canon of the Scripture is not perfect, as the Romanists would infer; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as the principal contents of those former Books are supposed to be found in the Books of the Chronicles and Kings; So it cannot be proved, but that all points necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which were set down in that former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> are either contained in these two Epistles which we have, or some other

If a man teach any Doctrine which may tend to the disparagement of the main doctrine of the Gospel, we must withdraw from him if he prove obstinate, though he do not deny directly any Fundamental. The Apostle, when he is charging <hi>Timothy</hi> to teach servants to obey their Masters, whether they be believing, or Infidels, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him to withdraw from them that teach the contrary, upon this ground, that such corrupt teaching would disparage the greater truths, and bring up an evil report against the Gospel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>That the name of God and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be not blasphemed, teach thus, and withdraw from them that teach otherwise.</hi>

                        <p>This was no Fundamental doctrine which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here defends; yet bordering close upon it, could not be denyed without much prejudice to the doctrine which is according to Godliness; without much dishonour and disparagement to the Fundamental point of holy life.</p>

                        <p>Some wrest it to weaken the Authority of the whole Scripture, seeking to pull down the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by Scripture, maintaining falsly, That the Letter of the whole Bible is a killing Letter, and therefore not a rule for Christians.</p>
                        <p>But this place thus used, is divided, and mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; The latter part of the verse is broken off from the former which expounds it, and shews that by the word <hi>[Spirit]</hi> is meant the new Testament, or the Covenant of grace, and consequently by the word <hi>(Letter)</hi> is meant the old Covenant of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:30732:73"/> works given to <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall. And the new Testament is called, <hi>Spirit,</hi> because it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the holy Spirit. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. As also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis spiritual in its nature, and ordinarily attended with the effectual ministry and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. And further: this place thus applied by Seducers is broken off with much violence from that plain text in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4.

                        <p>Again; the end of the Law; that is, the scope and intent of the Law was to drive us to Christ for righteousnesse; But it is not lesse than Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to say the Moral Law is ceased: For what is the Moral Law? See the first Commandement.<hi>—Thou shalt have no other Gods but me;</hi> is this cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? must we choose us new Gods? or is there no God? To say, down with the old Moral Law, is (in effect to say) down with our old Law-giver, and to decry God himself.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. The old Church in <hi>Moses</hi> time, which is called, The Church in the Wilderness, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 38.</p>
                        <p>This Church had many ignorant members in it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 28, 29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 8, 9, 10. And this was that state of this famous Church of Israel a long time after, <hi>Isay</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</hi> Hence some of Gods vlsible people are called, foolish, sottish children, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 22. <hi>My people is foolish, they are foolish chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Christs own little company: our Saviour and his twelve disciples were (at least) a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar visible Church, if not more: they had the marks
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:30732:81"/> of a Church upon them; they had among them the Word and Sacraments; were capable of dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all Church-Ordinances.</p>
                        <p>Of this little Church, some (if not all but Christ himself) were Fundamentally-ignorant, knew not some Fundamentals. <hi>Peter</hi> was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Christs absolute purpose to dye, and the necessity of his dying, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>Philip</hi> was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Christs Divine nature, and his equality with the Father, <hi>John</hi> 14. <hi>Thomas</hi> was ignorant of Christs Ascension, in the same chapter, <hi>John</hi> 14. 5. <hi>We know not whither thou goest.</hi> All the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were ignorant of the Resurrection for a long time, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 34.

                     <div type="reasons">
                        <head>Reasons.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. Because a man may be in the state of grace, and the favour of God, at such time as he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of some principles: the case of Christs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:30732:82"/> and others frequently mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                        <p>Now he that is in actual favour with God, is capable of Church-communion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1, 4. q. d. Let the Church receive him, for God hath received him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Because Christ himself admitted to Church-communion, such members as were Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ignorant: His disciples were ignorant of some Fundamentals, both before, and at, and after the Sacrament, yea, after Christ was risen from the dead, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 10, 11. yet he receives them to the Lords table, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Because Church-members are to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Church as members, before they have had time to learn all the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
                        <p>So soon as ever Christ called his disciples, they came to him immediately, and he presently recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, the same day that he first called them. He did not put them off till he had taught them to know distinctly all the Principles of Christianity. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 18, 19, 20▪ 21, 22.</p>
                        <p>The same day that <hi>Peter</hi> preached to the three thousand converts, they were baptised and made Church-members, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. The Apostles did not put them off from Church-membership till they kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>w all the Articles of faith; neither did they make exact enquiry into their distinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of every Principle; for 'tis utterly impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that three thousand persons should be throughly examined in one day: at least, it is the first-born of all improbabilities, that they could learn them all so soon, who were strangers to Christian religion before.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="139" facs="tcp:30732:82"/> 4. Because men and women are admitted into the Church, to learn the Principles of Religion, as those that have not learned them before, <hi>Isai</hi> 2. 2, 3. So Christ admitted his disciples into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, that he might have advantage to teach them better after, than before.</p>
                        <p>Thus Scholars that have not learned their Grammers, are admitted into schools that they may learn, and be Principled in the rudiments of knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Thus an Apprentice is received into a shop to learn his Trade, not because he knew it before. Hence the Apostles are commanded to disciple nations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. in the Greek it is, <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ye the nations,</hi> or, <hi>make them scholars,</hi> by bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them; admit them into the Church by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, that they may be as disciples, or scholars in Christs school; that is, that being admitted into the Church, they may learn the true Religion more perfectly. Hence it is that we read of some disciples, that after conversion were ignorant of the Gifts of the holy Ghost, a point commonly known in those days; and the Apostle meeting with them, taught it them after conversion, after they were become disciples, <hi>Acts.</hi> 19. 1, 2. And this was the case of all the Church-members, whose ignorance is before related, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Corinthians, Hebrews,</hi> and Christs disciples. They were admitted into the Church, not because they had learned all Principles before, but that they might learn those after, which they learned not before.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Because every ordinary Church consists of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:30732:83"/> Infants, besides grown persons, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Luk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>
                           </hi> 9. 47, 48. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 14.</p>
                        <p>Now as infants know no Fundamentals at all, so some grown persons (through the negligence of parents, or through their own dulness or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness) have but little knowledge, though ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church by Infant-baptism, according to Christs good will towards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Because of the different degrees of Church-members in every Church. Some are old men in faith and knowledge: Others are young men, and strong in apprehension, and sound judgement, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are babes, and children in understanding. So it hath been, and so it ever will be in the Church. Inequality of Gifts, and standing, and degrees in the Church, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14. Little children, fathers, young men. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 13, 14.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Because God hath special seasons of opening the understandings of his people after conversion, as well as before, and that in matters of greatest moment, in matters Fundamental, <hi>John</hi> 16. 12. <hi>Ye cannot bear them now:</hi> not now, when then? see <hi>verse</hi> 13. <hi>When the Spirit of truth is come:</hi> that is, when a greater measure of the Spirit shall come; for they had the Spirit before; they were truely gracious: yet they were to receive the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Spirit, more of the spirit than they had before. See a special season of illumination, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 44, 45, 46. <hi>Then opened he their understanding,</hi> now he gave them an open view of that great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of his rising from the dead, and of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:30732:83"/> concerning him, which they knew but darkly and confusedly before.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Because all the saints, all the members of the Church, have their day of small things; have all a beginning, a weak beginning in knowledge. Commonly their beginning is exceeding small, though their latter end doth greatly encrease: we are not men in understanding at first, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Otherwise, the Apostle speaks but vainly and unwarily, when he bids the Saints and Church-members, to be men in understanding, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 26. <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had but poor beginnings, but little knowledge, and little grace at first: Children, Babes, Novices, bruised Reeds, smoking Flax, Doubters at first: Afterwards the smallest Twigge becomes the tallest Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar.</p>
                        <p>Now he that knows all Fundamentals, is rather a man than a child in knowledge, as the Apostle hints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 13, 14. Here he calles him a Babe that is unskilful in the word of righteousness, with allusion to those <hi>Hebrews</hi> that were ignorant of Fundamentals: and he calls those men of full age, that had their sences exercised to discern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and evil. Thus all Christs disciples became men in understanding, when the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit had taught them all those Principles, which they could not bear, nor believe, nor fully appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend before.</p>
                        <p>Now if all the members of the Church be but rude in knowledge when they begin to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: then 'tis no wonder if we see a true Church with ignorant members in it; ignorant of some of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:30732:84"/> the Fundamental Principles, not able to apprehend them distinctly, clearly, in the sense of my present discourse.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the ignorance of Church-members can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove them Hereticks, though it be in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals.

                        <p n="2">2. That the ignorance of any members, cannot prove any Church to be no Church, or never to have been a Church. The case of old Israel before noted.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That ignorance in members cannot un-Church a Church, or make that cease to be a Church, which hath begun to be so. Otherwise, All the Churches of the New Testament should have been denyed by those Apostles which own them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That a man may be lawfully admitted to the Lords Supper, that knows some great Principles, though ignorant of others, if he practise those he knows, and desire to know more, as a new-born Babe.</p>
                        <p>Thus Christs disciples were admitted by Christ himself to his Table and last Supper, in a state of much darkness and ignorance. So the the old Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites to the Passover.</p>

                           <hi>Two words.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. You the friends of the Protestant Church in England! Abide in it. Let not either the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or scandals of particular members, make you to deny the Mother that bare you, and the Paps which you have sucked. Plead for your mother; plead, and never yield to those that say, We are no Church of Christ: for we have the true marks of his Church upon us; we hold the head; we keep the Foundation; we deny no truth border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Foundation; we do not allow the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of any of our members, but use all means of encreasing their knowledge; we have true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and a true Ministry; we endeavour after further Reformation; we bewail our scandals; we are a Pillar and Monument of Truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. O pray for the peace of our Jerusalem; and study the things that make for peace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 2, 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15, 16.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. You that have gone out from our Church, return again into her bosom, and help us to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. Consider, your main ground of Divorce from her, is no real ground, <hi>viz.</hi> Because of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and scandals of her members: you have heard this Argument enfeebled and broken; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to it no longer, never urge it more. If you could truely say, that we have no Foundation, no marks of a Church, I would hearken to you, and come off to you: But blessed be God, you cannot, you will not say, we are corrupted in the Word and Essential parts of the Sacraments, Then do not go out from us any further (as the Scripture

                     <p>
                        <hi>[Ye have need that one teach you again,</hi> &amp;c.] they were taught the Principles before, and now must be taught again. <hi>Observe—</hi>

                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. The first Principles of Religion are to be taughr and taught again in the Church: they had need be frequently taught to the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                     <p>How often did our Saviour inculcate, and beat upon his Disciples that great Principle of his Death and Resurrection; and that of Repentance and Regeneration, both before and after his Rising from the dead? <hi>Luke</hi> 24, 45, 46, 47.</p>
                     <p>The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> professeth that he will teach the same things so long as he lives, though the people knew them before, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
                     <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth the same things which he had taught before in all his Epistles, as <hi>Peter</hi> witnesseth of him, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15, 16. Yea he useth it as an Argument both to the <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to perswade them to receive this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, because he had taught the same before, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded to affirm the same things constantly, <hi>Tit</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:30732:86"/>
                     <p> The happier sort of <hi>Pauls</hi> hearers are desirers to hear repetition of the same points, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 42, 43, 44.</p>
                     <p>Reasons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because Principles are of more weight and necessity than other Truths. They are called, the weightier matters, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of these is more urged than the knowledge of other truths. For example; the knowledge of Christ Crucified, or of his Person and Office, is more stood upon, than the knowledge of Christs Geneologie. Both are alike revealed, but not alike urged, nor enjoyned under the like penalty. Who will say the story of <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Sampson, Pharoah, Joseph,</hi> is as necessary as the History of Christs Incarnation, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and the Doctrine of Christs Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship? <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Jude</hi> 3. <hi>I thought it needful,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Because Principles are a key of Knowledge. Compare <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 52. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 13. by a comparison of which places, you may perceive that ous Saviour calls the main doctrine of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, even the doctrine of the Kingdom of God, the key of knowledge. These capital Doctrines, these main Articles, give light and substance to all other truths, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 130. <hi>The entrance of thy word giveth light.</hi> The knowledge of the Office and merits of Christ, gives light to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Doctrine of our own unworthinesse, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. The Doctrine of our unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, gives light to the Doctrine of Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.</p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:30732:86"/>
                     <p> The knowledge of Christs Resurrection, gives light to the knowledge of the general Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 13, 16, 20, 21.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Because Principles are the Preachers Rule: They are a form for Ministers to make their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons by, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
                     <p>When do you see a good Carpenter or Builder, go to work without his Rule? or without his Line? Doth he not cut and square every piece of Timber with his Rule and Line? he often useth them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Because without knowledge of Principles a people cannot understand any other Truths suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. A man of no Principles, is a man of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and cannot receive any truth, till the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation be first laid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11, 12. q. d. I have many things to say concerning Christs Priesthood, hard to be uttered, and ye are dull of hearing, because your are so ignorant of Principles.</p>
                     <p>How can a man receive the doctrine of faith in God, that knoweth not this first Principle, That God is?</p>
                     <p>Who can believe the doctrine of Christs All-sufficiency, till he hath received this Principle, That Christ is the Son of God?</p>
                     <p>Who can receive the doctrine of the Scriptures, till he first believe that great Principle, That all Scripture is inspired of God? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19, 20, 21. <hi>John</hi> 5. 46, 47. chap. 20. 31.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Because frequent urging is commonly more effectual and prevailent than single teaching, or teaching but once. Importunity in a Preacher is most likely to prevail, and to win the soul of a Hearer. We read of the good success of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:30732:87"/> widdow; and we may read of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py success of the importunate Preacher, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies urging and pressing Principles.</p>
                     <p>Christs disciples did not understand the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his Resurrection at once hearing; but after frequent and much urging of the point. Hence God sends so many several Messengers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same errand, to the same people, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37. (often.)</p>
                     <p>Many of <hi>John</hi> Baptists hearers, were converted by Christs preaching, though <hi>John</hi> preached the same things and could not prevail, <hi>John</hi> 10. 41, 42.</p>
                     <p>He that is not converted in the third hour of the day of Grace, may yet be wrought upon in the sixth, or ninth, or eleventh hour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p>The urging of a Principle will make it sink deep and take the clearer impression; as in <hi>Peters</hi> case, when Christ urged him thrice, <hi>John</hi> 21.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Because of the constant succession of Church-members: one Generation goeth, and another cometh (saith <hi>Solomon.)</hi> Well principled Christians dye apace, and others weak in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge supply their rooms in the Church, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                     <p>Now, if Principles should not be frequently taught, when would novices in Religion get un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding? How would children in faith attain knowledge? <hi>David</hi> hath respect to such, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 11. So the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1, 2. So S. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 12. and you know <hi>Peters</hi> charge, <hi>Feed my lambs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Because of the natural dulness and forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Hearers. How apt are we to let slip the best
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:30732:87"/> things? <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Ye are dull of hearing.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let the best Christian say, They need not be put in minde of the same things: for if men of the purest mindes, and clearest judgements have no need of repetitions, and frequent urging of the same things, the Pen-men of the Scripture are much mistaken. Mark diligently these places, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 14. 15, 16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1, 2.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now to the Application of this point.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <p n="1">1. The needfulness of a preaching Ministry. How else shall people be well Principled? And how else shall the principles of Religion be urged? Yea, How shall they be defended without a sound Ministry, that shall be able to convince the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 17. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. One great end of the Gospel-Ministry, <hi>viz.</hi> to principle men aright in the true Religion. This was the end of the Old Testament Ministry, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 24,—29. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 22. How much more are the New-Testament Ministers to Principle men in Christianity? <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The design of Satan in stirring up his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to decry the office of the Ministry, <hi>viz.</hi> to destroy the Foundation of Christianity.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:30732:88"/> God designs the setting up of Religion, by setting up of the Ministry, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.

                        <p n="2">2. Lay up in your hearts and memories the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Fundamentals: Heed, and observe, and remember your Principles, and do not let them slip, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 18, 19. <hi>Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul.</hi> Deut. 32. 46, 47. <hi>Set your hearts unto all the words,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for it is your life.</hi> Note diligently, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                        <p>Here you must carefully distinguish too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Natural and a Spiritual memory, <hi>John</hi> 14. 26. <hi>The Spirit shall bring all things to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The natural memory is, when a man remembers the Principles of Religion without an heart to love and do them. Thus many a natural man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat a whole Sermon after he hath heard it, that never intends to obey it, yea many remember, to cavil and carp against it.</p>
                        <p>The Spiritual memory is, when a man remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers them to do them, when the heart and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry go together, <hi>Ps.</hi> 103. 18. <hi>Those that remember his commandments to do them.</hi>

                     <p>To open this Principle, I will propose two Questions.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>I. What we mean by the word, <hi>[God]?</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>II. Whether there be a God, nr no?</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Quest. 1. <hi>What is the meaning of the word,</hi> [God]?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> An Eternal First Essence or Being, without beginning or end. One that had Being before all other things had their being: not a Derivative, but Primitive being, the Spring of Beings; the Creator of beings, a mighty Sea of beings (as Dr. <hi>Preston</hi> phraseth it) that hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Artrib.</note> bank nor bottom, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16, 17. <hi>And he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things, and by him all things consist.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That we may clearly understand it, note four things concerning God. <hi>viz.</hi> That God is, 1. An
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:30732:95"/> absolute Essence, 2. A First Essence, 3. An Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Essence, 4. A Creating Essence.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God is an absolute Essence, existing abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely of himself, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>I am hath sent me unto you.</hi> I am, or Essence, is the proper Essential name of God: no creature can say of it self, I am; because no creature hath absolute being of it self, but only what is communicated to it of God. All creatures derive their beings from him, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. <hi>In him we live and have our being.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. God is the First Essence: never was any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him, or without him: hence he calls himself, <hi>Alpha,</hi> or Beginning; because he had a Being before all other beings, and gave them all a beginning. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and ending, the First and the Last.</hi> Isay. 44. 6. <hi>I am the First, the Beginning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. God is an Eternal Essence: one that hath a Being without beginning, and end; one that is from everlasting and to everlasting, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 1, 2. <hi>In all generations, before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth or the world, from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.</hi> According to that expression concerning <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedech,</hi> Heb. 7. 3. <hi>Without father, without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. God is a Creating Essence: a Being, which communicates Being; a spring of Beings: all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beings are but his off-spring, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. <hi>For we are also his off-spring,</hi> John 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:30732:95"/>
                     <p> So then, we mean by [God] an Eternal First Essence, or Being: one that hath absolute Being of himself, and causeth all other Beings.</p>
                     <p>Now, that there is such an Eternal Being, or Creator, I am to prove in the next question.</p>
                     <p>Question 2. <hi>Whether is there a God, or no? Is there indeed one that hath Being without Beginning or end, a Creating Essence?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a God that made the world, and all things therein. For proof whereof, I will open three Books, wherein you may read and spel God (as <hi>Du Plessis</hi> phrase is) <hi>viz.</hi> Creation, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Conscience.</p>
                     <div n="1" type="book">
                        <head>Book I.</head>
                        <p>1. The Book of Creation. The frame of the world bears witness to the Godhead: tis the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural language of Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and all the Host of them, That God is. The Sun, and Moon, and Stars; Men and Beasts; Fish and Fowl, have all a tongue to speak for their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 1. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>The invisible things of him from the Creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When I see an house, I say there hath been a Carpenter, though I see him not: even so when <note place="margin">Buchan. Perkins.</note> I look upon the frame and order of this great
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:30732:96"/> world, I must say it had a builder, though I be-behold him not. Hence is that golden sentence of Dr. <hi>Tayler;</hi> All the creatures are the Lords Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, teaching us his Eternity, Wisdome, Power, Goodness. And learned <hi>Du.

                        <p>Then I will conclude this argument with that of <hi>Calvin, Quaquaversum oculos conjicias, nulla est</hi>

                        <p>Some talk of Nature, as if all things came by Nature: but when the Philosophers themselves come to define Nature, and to shew what Nature is, they tell you in effect, tis God; and confessing God, they call him, <hi>Primam naturam,</hi> the first Nature; <hi>Principium</hi>

                        <p>The common way of Engendring, or Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankinde, proves, That there is a God; and that we may read this Book clearly, let us proced by degreees.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Man begets not a perfect grown man, but a Child, and Infant, yea an imperfect Embryon in the womb, without life or soul at first, at most, such a kind of imperfect man, as is not able to beget another man: every one that is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and born of a woman, is first an infant before he be a perfect man. This was the case of all
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:30732:97"/> thy Progenitours and Ancestours: But who begat the first infant? not an infant certainly, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man was the First-Begetter. So if we drive on this point of Generation from our selves to our fathers, and from them to our fore-fathers, at last we shall come to a First-Man that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an infant, but begat the second man of some woman that was never no infant neither; we shall come (in our thoughts) to a first couple, Male and Female, that were never begotten, but made or Created: For the First-Begetter being not an infant, but a perfect man, and the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being not an infant, but perfect woman, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately capable of conception, it appears they were both in perfect Being so soon as they had Being, and consequently not begotten, but made or created. And how could they be created with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Creator in Being before them, <hi>viz.</hi> God? <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 36, 27. <hi>God created man, &amp;c. male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male created he them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. No man is author of himselfe in Generation; every man had either a Father, or Creator, or both: thou hast a father, and thy father had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and they all had their fathers, and so at last we come to a first father, and from him to his Author, God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 100. 3. <hi>Know ye that the Lord he is God, it is he that made us, and not we our selves.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. No man is Authour of his child in Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: neither the father in Begetting, nor the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Conceiving, do know the making of him; neither of the Parents do once think of fashioning him in the womb: man takes no notice of all the fashion and parts of the child which he begets: for
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:30732:97"/> thousands and ten thousands of parents do not know the Anatomy of a man, and how many parts belong to a mans body, yet are their children as perfect and well-shaped, as the children of the greatest Artists and Anatomists under heaven: yea, many parents cannot have children though they would; others have them when they would not: another hath a daughter when he would have a son; and another begets a son when he would have a daughter: yet a Painter doth not so disapoint himself in drawing a Picture: Then thou art but an Instrument, not an Author, to form thy child in the womb. This is the work of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Thou hast covered me in my mothers womb,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am fearfully, and wonderfully made,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Now, our Not-Being, was before our Being, and yet we have a Being: therefore tis a power from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, that hath brought us out of Not-Being, into Being: otherwise out of that nothing which we were, we should never have come to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing at all: yea, betwixt nothing and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (how little soever that something is) there is an infinite distance; and therefore the Cause thereof must needs be infinite; and this infini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>3. The Book of Conscience. Every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science tells him there is a God: Natural instinct proves the Godhead. The Notion of a Deity is in-bred in the nature of man: and this shews there is a God: for if man were a God to himself, or Author of himself, how could he possibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the thought of another Author, or of a God without him? But this is an universal Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on written in the hearts and consciences of all Nations, That there is a God, a Creatour of all things. The Apostle speaking of the Heathens, saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>That which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath shewed it to them.</hi> This is that <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, that Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in mens hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. That is, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of Nature, written with the finger of God in the consciences of all men. If we ransak all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and parts of the world, where-ever we finde any men, there we shall finde a kinde of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and serving of God with Prayers and Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The <hi>Athenians</hi> had their Altar to serve God, though an unknown God, and him they ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worshipped, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. All Nations acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:30732:98"/> a God, though they differ in point of the true God. Yea, those wilde people, which live without law, without house, and that go stark naked, have some spice of Religion, and some glimmering conceptions of a Deity: which shews (saith a learned Writer) that it is not so <note place="margin">

The most invincible proof of this Natural Instinct, is every mans own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for when thou committest any crime (as Murder, Adultery, Blasphemy, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> though thou art in secret, yet terrours arrest thy Conscience, and thou art afraid at the thought of a God that sees thee, and will judge thee.</p>
                        <p>Now who should write this Principle in every man, but God? for an universal effect, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from an universal cause. Had it been written in the hearts of some few, we might think some particular man or Sect had been Author of it: but when you finde it in the hearts of all men, in all Nations and Ages (of never so different Notions and Opinions) we must conclude it to be written by the General Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Creator of all men, and all things, which is God alone, as the Apostle saith, <hi>God hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And though some fool may be found to say in his heart, <hi>there is no God;</hi> yet it is but sometimes that he saith so, not alwaies: a terrible clap of Thunder, or flash of Lightning, or fit of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, will make him change his note quickly.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. 'Tis one thing to have such a Notion in the brain, and another thing to believe it in the heart, unto salvation; for there are many knowing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which yet are not believers to salvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A man may know a thing, and yet forget it, till he be put in minde of it; so many which deny not a God, yet forget him, as <hi>David</hi> speaks, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 17.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A man may hold there is a God, and yet not consider the grounds why he thinks so; and this is the case of many ignorant people. Now what would become of such, if any Blasphemer (that had blotted out the Instinct of Nature by custome in sin, and judicial blindness) should
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:30732:99"/> print some book against the Godhead, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly discourse against it? Therefore the grounds and proof had need be taught, and frequently ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                        <p>How many are there (in these evil times) that were never well Catechised, nor soundly Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled in the Foundation of Religion, both children and others?</p>
                        <p>Yea the best and ablest Christians had need be put in minde of what they know already, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 15. and this is safe for them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Scripture teacheth, that the main grounds of Religion should be frequently urged upon the Consciences of men, and the state of the Church on earth requires it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 8. Yea this very Principle concerning God, is frequently taught and urged in the holy Scripture, to provoke men to worship God.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Therefore we preach this Doctrine of the Deity, and urge it upon mens Consciences, not because they know it not, but because they know it: for here we have our greatest advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the lusts of men, <hi>viz.</hi> in their own hearts and Consciences, which tell them we speak the truth; and their own hearts convince them, and reproach them for sinning against a known Deity: and this is the aggravation of their sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20, 21. <hi>They are without excuse, because when they knew God, they glorified him not as God.</hi>

                        <p>1. The beginning of the world, and of all things in in it. If there be a God, a Beginner of things, then there must needs be a Beginning begun by him: and this is the first word of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the first lesson that is taught in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ook of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</hi> The elements themselves had a beginning (as <hi>Du. Plessis</hi> proves by sound reason, and is easie to demonstrate) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things here below had a beginning: for the elements are the very Principles and Matter, out of which all other things do naturally arise, as any may read in the first of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular observation of the continual Production of the Elements; too large to handle at this time.</p>
                        <p>Besides; The soul of man (which is more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and excellent than other things, having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, will, memory affections) had its beginning, though it shall have no end: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by its imperfections, as ignorance, fear, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, it is not perfect at best, but most weak and childish at first, profiting and learning by degrees, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11. <hi>I understood as a child.</hi> And that which is not perfect at once, cannot be eternal; yea, tis ordinarily troubled about muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and transitory things: most things disquiet and discontent it, and it cannot help it self: yea,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:30732:100"/> the soul of man hath much ado to comprehend the meaning of eternity; it cannot imagine the vasteness of difference betwixt Time and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; it cannot easily imagine how things should come by their beginning by some Eternal; and therefore it is not of an Eternal nature: For were its nature Eternal, it would easily apprehend its own nature.</p>
                        <p>So much to the first point of Inference.</p>
                        <p>Again: we may hence Inferr,</p>
                        <p>II. The Nature of God: He is of a living, and Spiritual, and Eternal Nature. If he makes living creatures, he must needs be a living Creator, and have life in himself: and if he made all things, then he was before all things, and so Eternal: and if he made all things, then he made Angels, and the souls of men; and how could he shape and contrive Spirits, if he were not of a Spiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? How can a visible thing form and Create things invisible? or a temporal thing, Create a thing that is everlasting? Yea, if he made the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, out of which all corporeal things are formed, then he must needs be Spiritual, not Corporeal; but if he made all things, then the Elements themselves were made by him; and if all Bodies are compounded of the four Elements, then he himself must needs be excepted, who made all those Elements, out of which all bodies or corporeal substances do arise.</p>
                        <p>And this nature of God doth distinguish and difference Him, from all dead, and dumb, and dirty Idols. <hi>John</hi> 4. 24. <hi>God is a Spirit, and they</hi>

                        <p>Answer.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I mean not the inck and paper wherein the Old and New Testament are written or printed: in this sense there may be a thousand Scriptures, and Bibles: But the Scripture (in a right sense) is but one, and cannot be multiplied: The inck
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:30732:104"/> and paper may be thy book, or mine, or another mans, or of a friend, or any enemy; But that which I mean, is the book of God onely. The inck and paper is the same with other books.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Nor do I mean by Scripture, all the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, syllables, words, phrases, and periods of any Translation or Printed Copy of the Old and New Testament commonly extant and used among us, to be the Word of God: for both the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Printer may possibly fail in some smaller matters against his will; and an enemy of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble may Print it falsly on set purpose, through the instigation of the devil.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But I mean that which famous Writers have called <hi>The soul of the Scriptures, viz.</hi> The sense <note place="margin">S. <hi>Austin.</hi> M. <hi>Rich. Stock.</hi>
                           </note> and meaning of any sound Translation or Copy, taken out of the first Hebrew and Greek Original Manuscripts, which were written by the Pen-men themselves, even by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets, and Apostles of Christ; I say, the sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our English Translation, is that principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which I call the Scripture, and which I affirm to be the Word of God, so far as our said Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation agrees with the Hebrew Bible, and Greek Testament.</p>
                        <p>We read of the sense of the law, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 7, 8. of the meaning of the Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>hap.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 15. of the minde of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>But we have the minde of Christ.</hi> Yea, we read of the signification of the word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 8. <hi>ch.</hi> 12. 27.</p>
                        <p>This sense and signification of the Scripture is the principal thing which I call the Word of God: this chiefly, though not this onely.</p>

                           <pb n="178" facs="tcp:30732:105"/> 4. Yet further, by Scripture I mean all those several Books of the Old and New Testament, commonly called <hi>The Canonical Scripture,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at <hi>Genesis,</hi> and ending with the <hi>Revelations;</hi> and I believe that all these Books, Chapters, Verses, as they are written in the Original Languages, or soundly translated out of them, are the word of God; that is, they were all at first given by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration from God; and we must neither add to them, nor take away from them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.</p>
                        <p>Not onely the matter, and sense, but the style, the phrase, and every word of the first Manuscript is by inspiration from God.</p>
                        <p>And though Mortal men were the Pen-men, yet God was the Indicter and Inspirer of them. <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets, and Apostles, were the Pen-men, but the Holy Ghost, the hand that gni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their hands; men the instruments, but God himself the Author of this Book; God did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them to write it, for an everlasting Rule to his Church, <hi>Isai</hi> 30. 8. The Pen-men are not the Authours, but the Secretaries of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                        <p>Take my meaning then in few words, A Kings Laws may be written by his Secretary, and Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">A Simile.</note> by his Printer, and Printed Copies of these Laws come into the houses and hands of all his subjects: yet these Laws are neither the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, nor the Printers, nor the Subjects Laws, but the Kings Laws still. Again; thy father may deliver his will by word of mouth to a Scrivener, and the Scrivener may write it, and thy father sign and seal it: yet the will is not the Scriveners will, but thy fathers will; and the inck, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:30732:105"/> or parchment, is not so much the will, as the things themselves written; yea, the proper, plain sense of the writing is indeed thy fathers will, though the sorm also may be of his own indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting too.</p>
                        <p>Even so, the form, and phrase, and style of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, is of God; but the sense and true meaning of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>hem; is properly his Word and Will: and though he gave special order to men to write his will; yet it is not the will of man, but the will of God; as St. <hi>Peter</hi> tels us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>The Prophecie came not in old time by the will of man,</hi> &amp;c. Some small friends to the Bible, carp and cavil at us, because we call the Scripture the word of God: but let them know, that the Scripture gives this Title, not onely to Christ, but to it self also. What is Gods Word, but that which God speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? and how often do we read in Scripture these phrases, <hi>Thus saith the Lord: Thus saith the Lord: Ʋnto the wicked God saith.</hi> St. <hi>Johns</hi> Revelation is called <hi>The word of God,</hi> Rev. 1. 1, 2. <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy, Divide the word rightly,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 15. and (besides the word which is Christ, <hi>John</hi> 1. 1.) we read of the Word of Christ, who is God, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. And he bids us pray, that the Word of the Lord may have free course, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 1. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Prophets is it said, The Word of the Lord came to <hi>Isai, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,</hi> saying? &amp;c. What's the Preface to the ten Commandements? <hi>God spake these words, and said,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Haggais</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie is called, <hi>The word of the Lord,</hi> Hag. 1. 1, 2, 3. Many other places might be urged.</p>
                        <p>This is that which I am now to prove, That the first writing of the holy Scripture was from
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:30732:106"/> God: and the sense and meaning of this writing, which we call the Bible, is the Word and Will of God; the Revealed Minde and VVill of God, the undoubted Inspiration of the Almighty.</p>

                           <p> I will come up close to the Point, and form this Reason into a Connexive Syllogism, or</p>
                           <p>A Conditional Argument; Thus,</p>
                           <p>If there be no other Author of the Scriptures, Then God must of necessity be the Author of them:</p>
                           <l>But there is no other Author:</l>
                           <l>Therefore God must needs be Author.</l>
                           <p>The Proposition, or Major, is clear and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable: for tis a Rule of Reason, That every thing must have an Author or Cause, but God the Cause of Causes. <hi>Ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> Nothing produceth nothing.</p>
                           <p>The Assumption or Minor is thus proved, by</p>
                           <p>A second Argument, or Prossyllogism.</p>
                           <p>If the Scriptures be invented by any creature, it must be by some Reasonable creature:</p>
                           <l>But it is not invented by any Reasonable Creature:</l>
                           <l>Therefore by no creature at all.</l>
                           <p>The Proposition is clear, confirmed by a general Rule, a known Maxim or Principle of Reason, <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>z.</hi> without Reason can be no invention or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance. A Beast, a Stone, a Tree, a Fish, a Fowl, a Star, cannot invent matter for a Book.</p>
                           <pb n="183" facs="tcp:30732:108"/>
                           <p> The Assumption (or Application of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position) is easily proved, by</p>
                           <p>A third Argument, or Epilogism; Thus,</p>
                           <p>If the Scripture be invented by any Reasonable creature, then it must be by some Man, or some Devil, or some Angel:</p>
                           <l>But it is not invented by any Man, or Devil, or Angel:</l>
                           <l>Therefore by no Reasonable creature.</l>
                           <p>The Proposition is clear, and undeniable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a General Rule, a known Principle of Reason: <hi>viz.</hi> That there are no other Reasonable creatures, but Men, and God, and evil Angels. The Sun, and Moon, and Stars, and Beasts, and Birds, and Fish, and Stones, and Trees, and Plants, are all unreasonable creatures, they cannot Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Argue, Talk, Discourse, Counsel, Direct, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, or Contrive.</p>
                           <p>The Assumption (or Application of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the Point in hand) is easie to be proved, by an Induction of particulars, concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity, and Indisposition of Men, or Devils, or Angels, to the first devising or invention of the Scri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Three Particulars to clear the Question, and to conclude it by this Argument.</p>
                           <p>I. It is not invented by any man: for there are but two sorts of men, good or evil, godly or wicked: and neither of these did invent the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                           <pb n="184" facs="tcp:30732:109"/>
                           <p>1. Not any wicked man; for a wicked man nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would nor could make, or cause to be made, such a Book, or such writings.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. He would not if he could; for it is a Book that damns all wicked men to hell and eternal torments; and denounceth all manner of Curses against the wicked, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 15, to the end, <hi>Isai</hi> 3. 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. He could not if he would: for he could not have thought of Holiness, Regeneration, Repentance, the New-creature, and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. He could never write such Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as these, <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. 44 45. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Mal.</hi> 18. 3.</p>
                           <p>2. Not any good man: for a good man neither would nor could make, or cause to be made, such Book or writing, without God.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. He would not if he could: for a good man would not dare to counterfeit himself to be a God; and to tell the world tis the Book of God, when he himself had forged it. A good man durst never utter such sayings, and Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as these, <hi>Thus saith the Lord, Thus saith the Lord;</hi> and, <hi>Hear, O Heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken!</hi> Isai 1. 2. ch. 9. 8. 1 Cor. 11. 23. <hi>I have received of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. He could not if he would: for there are many things in Scripture above the reach and understanding of man, and beyond his inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as the Trinity; the Incarnation of Christ; the Resurrection; the Convincing of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; the Searching of Hearts; the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling of things to come; of which more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <pb n="185" facs="tcp:30732:109"/> 3. Not any Hypocrite with a good tongue, and evil heart; for (besides that the matters in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are above man) of all other men the Bible inveighs most against Hypocrites, pouring out most bitter woes and curses against them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 13. &amp;c. ch. 24. 51. <hi>Job</hi> 27. 8.</p>
                           <p>II. It is not invented by any Devil: for a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil neither would nor could.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. He would not if he could: for he is an utter enemy to them, and they to him: they cry down all Devils to hell, they destroy the works of the Devil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41. <hi>Jude</hi> 6. They call upon all men to resist the Devil, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8, 9. And the Devil sets himself against them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. He could not if he would: the Devil cannot invent Holiness, Repentance, Faith, Godliness, Love to God, and good men, and good things: For he is the grand Author of all mischief, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Similis simili Gaudet.</hi> Like will love like. Neither can he certainly foresee future events.</p>
                           <p>III. It is not invented by any good Angel: for a good Angel neither would nor could.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. He would not: for it is not incident to a good Angel to lye, and cosen, and dissemble, and cheat the world, and seign himself to be God, as this Author professeth himself to be, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. He could not, for two reasons.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. God would not suffer such a liar in heaven, but would detect him, and reject him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 7.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. An Angel cannot foretel things to come
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:30732:110"/> of himself, nor search the heart, nor work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, <hi>Isai</hi> 41. 23. Tis far more likely and comely for Angels to be admirers, rather than Authors of these glorious Writings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11, 12.</p>
                           <p>Thus much to the first Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> If there be no other Author of the Scripture, then God is the Author: But there is no other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <head>The Second Argument.</head>
                           <p>2. The necessity of a Rule of VVorship, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the denyal of all other Rules, as insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and not able to make claim to God for their Author.</p>
                           <p>All wil grant, That God ought to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: That the Rule of worship is not mans will, but Gods will: That (of necessity) the will of God must be revealed to man, before he can do it. This is all sound Reason, and is proved by its own light.</p>
                           <p>Now these Concessions lead us to further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie: <hi>viz.</hi> VVhat is Gods Revealed will? what Rule hath he set? what is the rule of Service or VVorship? is it the Scripture, or some other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation or VVriting?</p>
                           <p>And now this Argument presents it self to full view to satisfie this enquiry.</p>
                           <p>If God hath revealed his minde at all to man, then he hath done it, either in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture or some other Writing or Revelation:</p>
                           <pb n="187" facs="tcp:30732:110"/>
                           <l> But he hath not Revealed his minde in any other Writing or Revelation:</l>
                           <l>Therefore in Scripture.</l>
                           <p>The Argument is grounded on this Natural Principle, Of immediate contraries, one must needs be in the subject, the other not in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which is capable of one of them.</p>
                           <p>We finde the same Argument, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 7, 8, 9, 10, 13. where Christ calls the Scripture written by <hi>Moses,</hi> the word of God, and rejects all other Rules, calling all other Rules, Commandments of men, Traditions of men.</p>
                           <p>In the last page of the New Testament, the Scripture useth this Argument in its own defence, rejecting all other Rules, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18. <hi>If any man shall add unto these things,</hi> &amp;c. q. d. Tis death to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man to own any other Rule, as Gods inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Tis like that Argument, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. q. d. Not of Works, <hi>ergo</hi> of Grace.</p>
                           <p>Tis like that of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 10. 8. All that came before me were thieves and robbers; <hi>Ergo,</hi> I am the true sheapherd.</p>
                           <p>And this seems to be <hi>Elijahs</hi> Argument to Israel, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 21. Why halt ye? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If <hi>Baal</hi> be God, follow him, but if the Lord, follow him, q. d. Either the Lord is God, or <hi>Baal,</hi> or some other; But neither <hi>Baal,</hi> nor any other; Therefore the Lord is God.</p>
                           <p>Now let me come up close to the point, and prove, That no other Revelation or Writing is from God, as the Rule of Worship, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle asserts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9.</p>
                           <p n="1">
                              <pb n="188" facs="tcp:30732:111"/> 1. Not the immediate Revelations from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> before the Scriptures were written they are not our Rule now: for the Scripture one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reveals them to us, so far as we know them: and we know no more of them than the Scripture acquaints us. Therefore these two cannot come into competition, being one, so far as we know. What God said to <hi>Abraham</hi> is called the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Not the Light of Nature: for that is so dim, that men that walk thereby worship an unknown God, as did the Athenians, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. others wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the creatures instead of the Creator. The discovery which nature makes is marvelous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure. You have heard how <hi>Simonides</hi> the great Philosopher was puzzl'd and put to a stand when one asked him, what God was? and how he desired two days respite; and then two days more; and then two daies more; then being asked why he did so; because (saith he) the more I seek after him, the further off I am from finding him. Some have worshiped men, images, stocks, and stones, and all the host of heaven, some the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Of which much is written by learned men. See <hi>Du Plessis</hi> of the trueness of Religion.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Not any other Writing, for</p>
                           <p n="1">1. All other writings are the inventions of men, and their Authors are known to be men, and they write them in their own name, and seek the advancing of themselves by them; or else they set up some man to be God; as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet, and the like.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. All other writings want miracles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:30732:111"/> them. Their Authors could do nothing Supernatural. Of this more hereafter.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. All other writings have mixtures of dross, of untruths and impurities in them: As the Alcaron and other writings. <hi>Mahomet</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised his Disciples a Paradise, wherein they should have all sensual pleasures, and enjoy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. All other writings are of later date than the Scripture: they are all but of yesterday in comparison to <hi>Moses</hi> writings. This Antiquity of <hi>Moses</hi> writings is thrice together urged by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 21, 27, 33. <hi>It hath been said by them of old time,</hi> and the Scripture is called, That which was from the beginning, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. And this Antiquity of <hi>Moses</hi> writings is confessed by all heathen writers (of note) themselves. As many worthy writers have urged out of <hi>Tertullian, Eusebius, Justine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> and <hi>Du Plessis</hi> quotes the particular say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the heathens out of their own books, too large to transcribe. And <hi>Moses</hi> writings contain the summe and substance of all other Scripture; and the New Testament is founded upon the Old, and so in some sence all may be termed as Ancient as <hi>Moses, John</hi> 5. 46, 47. <hi>Moses</hi> wrote of Christ: and the Covenant of Grace is in his writings, and they are called, The Gospel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. you see, there is no other Rule.</p>

                           <head>The Third Argument.</head>
                           <p>3. The gift of miracles, and working wonders,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:30732:112"/> which was given to those that have asserted, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or written the doctrine of the Bible. This shews their heavenly descent and Divine pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, and proves them to be the Off-spring of God.</p>
                           <p>This Argument we finde proceeding out of the mouth of Scripture in defence of it self, <hi>John</hi> 14. 11. Yea, and thus Reason dictates to the mindes of the people that heard Christ, when they saw his miracles, <hi>John</hi> 7. 31. <hi>When Christ cometh will he do more Miracles than these?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Moses, Joshua, Elijah, Elisha, Daniel,</hi> Christ, and his Apostles, could all work soul-astonishing Miracles, or rather, God by them did all these things.</p>
                           <p>You have heard of the drying up of the Red sea, of the cutting off of the waters of Jordan, of the standing still of the Sun, of stopping the mouths of Lions, of making the blinde to see, the lame to walk, the deaf to hear; you have heard of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sick, cleansing lepers, raising the dead, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting out of Devils, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 8.</p>
                           <p>The strength of the Argument.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. They were real: False miracles stand onely in appearance, they have no substance or solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them: as the miracles that inchanters do, they are but <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, only appearances, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; as if they give money, 'twill afterward prove but dry leaves: and such were the miracles of the inchanters of <hi>Egypt:</hi> but look upon the miracles of <hi>Moses;</hi> they were solid: as the <hi>Mannah</hi> from heaven fed the people many years
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:30732:112"/> the water that came out of the rock did refresh them: the plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> were real; they felt them, and the first-born were really smitten, and dyed, and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his chariots, and horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were drowned, they sank like lead in the mighty waters. The miracles also of Christ and his Apostles were real; the blinde, and lame, and deaf, and dumb, were really resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. They were incomparable miracles: such as none other could work, but those that wrought them to confirm the Scripture. Neither the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, nor any Magicians, nor Sorcerers, could ever come near them. They are works besides, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the course of Nature, and second causes, and therefore done by the power of God onely, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 18, 19. <hi>The Magicians could not.</hi> Then they said, This is the finger of God. Yea, the Magicians could not save themselves from the lash of <hi>Moses</hi>'s miracles, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 11. <hi>The boyls were upon the Magicians. Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer was struck blind, and groped for some to lead him, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 11. Yea these Miracles converted many Witches and Conjurers, from their Sorceries, and made them burn their books, and acknowledge Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 18, 19.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. They were famous publick miracles, not done in corners, but on the house tops; not as many false miracles are done before two or three, and told to many; but they were done before many thousands. <hi>Moses</hi> his Miracles were done in the presence of a great King, and all his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and his enemies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 10, 11. So Christs, and his Apostles, in the face of their very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:30732:113"/> in the sight of the Sun, and the presence of all the people, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 22, 23. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 16. So the standing still of the Sun, the Mannah from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the water flowing out of the rock; So <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs</hi> and <hi>Elishas</hi> miracles were done openly before a multitude of witnesses.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. They are approved Miracles; owned and confirmed by the Confessions and Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Enemies of the Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 11. 47, 48.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The Miracles of <hi>Moses</hi> are acknowledged and reverenced by the most Ancient writers. <hi>Artabanus</hi> an Heathen reporteth, That the King of Egypt required of <hi>Moses</hi> signs, and that thereupon he turned his staff into a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; that he smote the river <hi>Nyle,</hi> and made it overflow; that he smote the earth, and it brought forth venemous flyes, next froggs, then grass-hoppers, afterwards other strange things.

                           <p n="3">3.

                           <p>4. The Prophecies of Scripture: they shew that whoever was the Author of it, he saw many great events and alterations in the world, whiles they were yet secret, and wrote them down in his book, while as yet there was none of them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>The scripture fore-seeing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                           <p>Objection. <hi>But what difference is there between the Prophecies of Scripture, and the Predictions of South-sayers?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Solution.</hi> The difference lies in four points.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Scripture-Prophecies are particular, not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> are named: <hi>Jericho</hi> named: <hi>Josiah</hi> named many years before he was born. You have it 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. <hi>A childe shall be born, Josiah by name.</hi> He names the very man that should perform it. So <hi>Syrus</hi> is named in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> Prophecie concerning him, and that about an hundred years before he was born, and probably, before his parents were born, who were at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to have given him another name. <hi>Isai</hi> 44. 28. Chapt. 45. 1. 4. Thus you see Scripture-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies are particular, not general.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Scripture-Prophecies are plain and perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: For all circumstances are set down accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they came to pass: They are not obscure and ambiguous, like the Delphian Oracles, which a man might construe any way. This was one of those doubtful Oracles,</p>
                           <pb n="195" facs="tcp:30732:114"/>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ibis, redibis, nunquam per Bella peribis.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The same words will bear a contrary sense, if you put <hi>redibis</hi> and <hi>nunquam</hi> together,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ibis, redibis nunquam, per bella peribis.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But Scripture-Prophecies are not so doubtful and uncertain; there can but one sense be fastned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: as that about the building of <hi>Jericho;</hi> the captivity of Israel; the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the coming of Christ; the destruction of Jerusalem, &amp;c. The Scripture foretold plainly, and without equivocation, that Christ should be God, should be the Son of God, and that he should be man, and born of a virgin; that he should come out of the Family of the house of <hi>David;</hi> that his own Nation should reject and execute him; that he should be born in the place, and at the time that he was born. The time of Israels bondage in <hi>Egypt</hi> was set, <hi>viz.</hi> four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; the time of the Captivity was pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually set, <hi>viz.</hi> seventy years; the time of Christs coming in the flesh was set, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Scepter departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> Gen. 49. 10, 11.</p>
                           <p>This Ppophecie was punctually fulfilled at the time limited, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Jesus was born in the daies of Herod the King.</hi> This <hi>Herod</hi> was a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and of another nation, and he cut off the line and house of <hi>Judah</hi> from the Government of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and established himself Governour, and King over them; and thus the Scepter departed from
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:30732:115"/>
                              <hi>Judah;</hi> which Scepter or Government came in, in the person of King <hi>David,</hi> and went out in the person of <hi>Hircanus,</hi> whom <hi>Herod</hi> slew, he being the last King of <hi>Davids</hi> race. As <hi>Josephus</hi> a Jew reporteth; and is confirmed by other grave Historians of those times.</p>
                           <p>We conclude then: That Scripture-Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are plain, and certain, and punctual, setting the time, and place, and other circumstances, without any equivocation, ambiguity, or prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and herein they excel all the Predictions of Wilards, South-sayers, Prognosticators, or any humane Fortune-Tellers.</p>
                           <p>I will add one more point of difference betwixt the Prophecies of Scripture, and all other Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies whatsoever, <hi>viz.—</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>3. Scripture-Prophecies are comprehensive, of a vast and large extent: They comprehend and fore see matters of hundreds, yea, thousands of years, yea, of all Ages from the beginning of the world to the end of it: which proves them to be above the reach of Nature, and Natural causes. The Scripture Prophesied of the Egyptian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and the time of its continuance, <hi>viz.</hi> four hundred years; and it Prophesied of Christs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming two thousand years before it came to pass; yea, they comprehend all matters that are, or shall be to the end of the world: It Prophesies what shall be in the last days, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>ite the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter.</hi> Rev. 10. 6, 7. <hi>There should be time no longer,</hi> &amp;c. I suppose no South-sayer ever pretended to such a comprehensive prophecie.</p>
                           <pb n="196" facs="tcp:30732:115"/>
                           <p>Here I will answer on Objection.</p>
                           <p>Objection. <hi>But you speak of the Prophecies of Jacob, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Moses: these are all in ancient time (as you say) and therefore out of memory; and it might be some feigned story; and if done, they were done long ago: They that saw them are all swept away, and who can say, they were so indeed? Bibles may be changed for ought we know, in all this time.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Solution.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I Answer, First, <hi>Moses</hi> left his writings in the Church, as a Monument of all Passages in his time; and so <hi>Joshua,</hi> Josh. 8. 30, 31, 32. which the many thousands of Israel would never have owned as a Law from heaven, if they could have disproved a tittle of it; for many of them were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the Law, and hated it, and brake it.</p>
                           <p>2. The Prophets (after <hi>Moses</hi> many hundred years) confirm the books and Doctrine of <hi>Moses,</hi> by Doctrine and Miracles.</p>
                           <p>3. Christ, and his Apostles confirm <hi>Moses</hi>'s wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings by their Doctrine and Miracles.</p>
                           <p>4. The Heathens themselves confirm the truth of them by their writings and histories, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shewed, they recorded <hi>Moses</hi>'s miracles in their own books.</p>
                           <p>5. Many thousand Martyrs have sealed the same with their bloud.</p>
                           <pb n="198" facs="tcp:30732:116"/>
                           <p> 6. We have the Testimony of the whole Church in all Ages, that these are the very wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; who have ventured their salvation upon the Bible, and therefore would not suffer it in any age to be changed. Jews and Christians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent about the Books of the Old Testament: Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Protestants about the substance of the New. Yea, we have the universal consent of all Christians of never so different opinions; who dare not say the Bible is changed, though it oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth their opinions, and they are pinched with the Authority of it.</p>
                           <p>7. Tis impossible the Scripture should be changed or Adulterated. For</p>
                           <p n="1">1. How hard is it to suppress or change the Books of any Humane writer, yea the most wicked Books that are? and God is more able to preserve his writing than man. Here I might inlarge, but I restrain my conceptions on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. 'Twas the Jews Principle, to chuse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die an hundred times over, than to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Law to be changed in the least, as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> witnesseth: yea, tis famously known of the Jews, that they were more zealous of the Words, Letters, Syllables of the Law, than of the sense: and Christ witnesseth of them, that they prized the Scripture so highly, that they thought to have eternal life in them, <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. and though Christ frequently corrects the false Glosses put upon the Scripture, yet he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver faults the Text. And in <hi>Pauls</hi> time they were perfect, and not changed. (Text) 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17.</p>

                              <pb n="199" facs="tcp:30732:116"/> 3. Since the Apostles days (who published the Scriptures throughout the world, and were careful to commit them to trusty hands when they dyed, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.) they cannot be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or corrupted: for the friends of the Gospel have been living (by Successions and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) ever since: the Church hath never been utterly extinguisht, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. chap. 28. 20. Now though the enemies of Christ might seek to deprave the Scriptures, yet his friends would not consent to it; but have kept their Copies or Bibles unspotted: and besides, the whole world would hear of it, it could not be kept secret, if once attempted.</p>
                           <p>Objection. <hi>But the Pope hath changed them.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Solution.</hi> I Answer, Tis both false and incredible that the Popes should have depraved our Bibles.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Our Bibles are the greatest Engines in the world to batter down Popery: and surely if he had changed them, he would have expunged all those Texts which make against him and his cursed Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Pope labours with all his might to keep the Common people from vulgar Translations of the Scripture into a known tongue, lest the people should discover his Abominations; which he need not fear, but that he knows he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:30732:117"/> the Fountains if he would, nor destroy any one Book of Scripture.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Though the Pope had some Original copies at the time of the Romish Apostacie, yet he had not all Original copies of the Bible: But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants that separated from Rome, had also seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Greek and Hebrew Copies in several places of the world; as is clear to experience: for how should we have English Translations without O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Copies? Yea our Translations agree with those Transcripts, which the Grecian Churches, and other Churches had: And if we have no Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, why do not the Papists object it against us, who have left no stone untruned to destroy our Religion?</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The Bible cannot be changed without an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall consent of the whole Church, of every Christian that hath a Bible; which is impossible to obtain.</p>
                           <p>Suppose such a design should be attempted in England, a man should finde it as easie a task to put the Sun out of the firmament, as to perswade all the Christians in England (much less all the Christians scattered up and down in the whole world) to consent to the wronging or mangling of any part or book of the Scripture.</p>
                           <p>Yea, suppose such a wickedness should be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in this town, a man might as easily pull down the pillars of heaven, as gain the consent of every Christian in the town to the Embasing or Corrupting of the Bible in any of the Essentials of Christianity. Or if all should be thought so wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet there having been alwaies different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the Church, they could never agree
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:30732:117"/> which part should be taken away: that Book or Text making for one side which is against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and what advantage could one party have against the other, more than a just charge of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterating or changing the Scripture?</p>
                           <p>See then, the shamelesse impudence of those that would infinuate into the Minds of men, that the Pope hath corrupted the Scripture, and that the Protestants have no other Copyes of the Scripture, than what they had from the Pope: when 'tis famously known, that the Pope is so far from delivering his Copyes to the Protestants to be translated into English, and other Languages, that he rather useth all his Power and Policy to keep the Scriptures from being divulged or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in any Mother tongue. Therefore it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Protestants translate the Bible out of their own Copyes which God hath preserved among them, not out of Roman Copyes; <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">See <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> Abel Rediv. and Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> his Mart.</note> and <hi>Tindal,</hi> as I remember, and other blessed Martyrs, laboured in this blessed work.</p>

The End and Aim of the Scripture, It shews from whence they are; The end of this writing is the Glory of God: It abaseth Nature, advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Grace of God; and therefore 'tis from God. The Pen-men (or Hagiographers) seek not their own praise, but the praise of God. <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> write their own miscarriages; <hi>Moses</hi> seeks not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment and glory of his own Tribe: He doth not deliver the Scepter to his own Tribe, but in his Prophecies he speaks worse of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> than of any other, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 5, 6, 7.

                           <p>The nature and properties of the Scriptures sheweth from whence they are. As, 1. Their holiness; They call upon men for conformity to the Divine nature. They are called, Holy Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. 2. Another property is their purity, there is nothing unholy in them, it hath no mixture of uncleaness, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 8. 9. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 7. Moral writers allow unnatural uncleaness, and call that Vertue which is Sin; <note place="margin">Plato.</note> They commend Envy at unworthy men, and lightness of talk, and Pride in a mans own gifts; <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, or, a judging of a mans self worthy of great things when he is so, contrary to the Christians principle, <hi>Luke.</hi> 17. 10. <hi>Seneca</hi> commends that as a vertuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution in <hi>Cato,</hi> rather to lay violent hands upon himself, and destroy himself, than to fall into the hands of <hi>Caesar</hi> his enemy. The Author of the second book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> commends one <hi>Razis</hi> a Jew for killing himself, 2 <hi>Macc.</hi> 14. 41. <hi>&amp;c. Mahomet</hi> gives out that he had license from God to know any woman that he would. By these examples it appeareth, that other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                              </note> are not comparable with Scripture for puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: There's drosse, and Scum, and refuse in them all, the best of them. 3. Another property is their power and efficacy: They are able to search the heart, which nature it self teacheth, is proper to God only, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 18, 19, 29. Yea, they can shew a man such things in his heart, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self knew not to be there, before the Scripture
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:30732:119"/> revealed them to him, as in <hi>Hazaels</hi> case, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. 12, 13. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 12. They can search all hearts in all ages, they know the thoughts a far off: They know what men will think, thousands of years before they are born; <hi>Moses</hi> wrote what our thoughts are, and what all men thoughts are, and shall be; and this is proper to God only, the searcher of hearts, and men could not do it without intelligence from Heaven, and notice from God. Again: They are able to terrify men, with its threatnings, to comfort them with its promises; yea to convert their Souls, to make a marvellous change and alteration in the Spirits, Thoughts, Dispositions, and Inclinations: yea a super-moral Conversion: where morality ends, and can reach no farther, there the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture begins many times: That which moral Principles and Philosophy cannot do, this is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy to the Scripture, as in <hi>Pauls</hi> case, he was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally honest before his change, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>&amp;c. Mat.</hi> 5. 20. This is all from God. 4. Another property is, Authority: what high language, and in what majestique stile the Scripture speaks to all sorts and degrees of men in the world? It speaks like God; Its voyce is as the voyce of God; with what God-like Authority they call for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention! <hi>Isay</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 10. what terrible threats it denounceth! <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 13, 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 7. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 17. what que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions it puts to the Conscience! <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 25, 31. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 33. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 18. what Creature could invent such que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions before the Scriptures were written? what God-like Ironies, and majestick Taunts are in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:30732:119"/> it? 1 <hi>R.</hi> 18. 27. <hi>Judg.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 3. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. 9. <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 4, 5. Thus God laughs at wilful man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 26. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 4. 5. Another property of the Scripture, is super-natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, or Invention; As besides the Prophecies, many deep mysteries concerning God and Man, which Nature could not find out. Man could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have thought of the mystery of the Trinity, the mystery of God manifest in the flesh, the mystery of Regeneration, the mystery of self-denyal, of Contempt of the World, and of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Communion with God in this and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World. Man can hardly understand them when reveiled; much lesse could he invent them before they were reveiled from Heaven. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 13, 14. 6. Another proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Scriptures, is contempt of the proud, not of the humble (as the fashion of the world is) but the proud contemnets of God; A slighting and undervaluing of the highest hairy Scalps that go on still in wickednesse, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>He that heareth, let him hear, and he that forbeareth, let him forbear.</hi> chap. 20. 39. <hi>Go yee, serve yee every one his Idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken so me. q. d.</hi> Change Masters when you will, I can have Servants enough if you were in Hell. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 17.

These are terrible and high sayings of God. The Sharpnesse, and Highnesse, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of these Expressions, declare the Scriptures
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:30732:120"/> to be a writing by themselves, full of Authority and preheminence, and framed by that God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom all Nations are but as the drop of a bucket, and who taketh up the Isles as a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thing.</p>

                        <p>1. Inference; Are the Scriptures from God? Then gather from hence</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The distinction betwixt the Author, and Pen-men of the Scripture. The Pen-men are not the Authors. <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> the Prophets and Apostles wrought the Scripture; But not in their own Names or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. I have proved that God is the only Author, and Inditer, or Inspirer of them: But the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were holy men of God. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20, 21. <hi>Holy men of God were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Holy-Ghost was the Father of Christ In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate: But the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was the happy Instrument that brought him into the world. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 34, 35.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Plainnesse of the Scripture: when God speaks, he speaks plainly and profitably. God would never give a dark obscure rule, which none can understand. 'Tis called a light which shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in a dark place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. 'Tis plain and clear in it self, though the natural man discerns it not. 'Tis true, some things are hard, but to whom; to the ignorant, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. There are difficulties in some places; but in other places
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:30732:120"/> all is made plain, if necessary to Salvation. He that cannot understand it must blame himself; St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, If I do shew a man a Star with my finger, and he hath a weak sight, and cannot see it, let him not blame my finger, but his own Eye sight.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Universal Rule: The Scripture is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to all men of all Ages and Conditions, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects every reasonable Creature, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. to all Nations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. both Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. They are written for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of former times, and present Generations. <hi>Ro.</hi> 15. 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>Ro.</hi> 4. 23, 24. 'Tis written for all men. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 30. <hi>Isay.</hi> 8. 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. Those that are Enemies to God, it directs them to Peace with God, and to the means and terms of Peace; It directs them to the Peace-maker, and to the Conditions of Peace, Christ, and Faith, and Repentance; And those that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, it directs them how to love and obey God, how to worship God, how to hate Evil and do Good, and to love one another.</p>
                        <p>Here's direction for all Ranks and Conditions of men; It directs what to believe, and what to <note place="margin">Credenda &amp; agenda.</note> do: Here's a Rule for Magistrates, Ministers, Church-Members; For the un-Married, and Married; For all Families of the Earth; For all the Relations in a Family; For Husband and Wife; For Parents and Children; For Masters and Servants; For Prosperity and Adversity; For Life and Death.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The sufficiency of the Scripture, both to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect men, and to maintain its own Authority; God is perfection it self, and therefore cannot
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:30732:121"/> write imperfectly; <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 7. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18, 19.</p>
                        <p>1. It needs not Church-Authority, to make it a perfect rule. Some Papists have spoken very blasphemously of the word of God. The President of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> saith, the Scriptures have no more Authority, than Esops-fables, without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The question is not what Authority the Church doth give to the Scriptures, but what Authority they have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; But if they do believe the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, what is it which makes that Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to believe that the Scripture is the word of God? If I must believe it, because the Church believes it, upon what grounds must the Church it self believe it, but upon the Scriptures own Authority; And if the Authority of the Scripture be the Churches ground of faith, why may it not be mine also? Again, what Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath the Church to judge of Scripture, till it be known to be a true Church, which cannot be known but by the Scripture? Besides, which was first, the Scripture, or the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> The Antiquity of the Scriptures gives it more Authority; Moreover the Scripture is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church, and therefore it needs not its testimony, but the Church cannot stand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Scriptures testimony; <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. When we believe, let us not believe for the saying of the Church, but for the Scriptures themselves, for they are from God.</p>
                        <p>2. It needs not traditions of men to make it perfect: to teach Traditions to be necessary, is to affirm that God left his word imperfect, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:30732:121"/> man makes it perfect; <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 7, 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let me aske the Papist, did God forget to set down in his word, St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successors, Invocation of Saints, Prayer for the dead, Popes Pardons, &amp;c?</p>
                        <p>We deny not but the Apostles might keep in memory many excellent speeches and sayings of Christ (as that in the <hi>Acts, Act.</hi> 20. 35. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, Tis a more blessed thing to give than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) But if there be any Tradition that for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is not to be found in the word, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, because the Scriptures are sufficient. What saith St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> I seek it in the Gospel, if I find it not there, where shall I find it?</p>

                        <p>The first thing proposed is, to shew you what I mean by Person. I mean thereby—A single and reasonable Substance, subsisting of it self, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Division or Communication.</p>
                        <p>I will open the Description, because it is an Introduction to that which followeth.</p>

A Person is a Substance; 'Tis not an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or Quality, or Attribute, but a Substance it self; Angels, and Souls, and Bodies, and all particular Creatures, are Substances; much more God himself who gave them Substance, and so the Persons of God.</p>

The Sun, and Moon, and Stars, are single Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stences, though not Persons, because they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist every one in its self, not in its Fellow: So o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, Men, and Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

A Person is not communicable, as the Essence is; The nature of things is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable to all of that kind: The Nature of man, is common to all men, the Nature of Angels, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Angels: So the Essence and Nature of the Divinity is common to all the Persons in the Deity; but the Persons are not common. For Instance, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> are two Persons, they are both Substances subsisting: But <hi>Peter</hi> is in such a manner <hi>Peter,</hi> that he cannot be <hi>Paul.</hi> So the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are Persons, subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themselves, but the Fathers Person is in such a manner his Person, that it cannot be the Person of the Son, nor Holy Ghost, <hi>&amp;c. Zanchy</hi> saith, a Person is, <hi>Substantia individua, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicabilis, an undividual, and incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Substance.</hi> Wollebius, <hi>Substantia proprietate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicabili ab alia differens; A Substance that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from all other by some incommunicable property.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. A person is a reasonable Substance; and so it hath life, and understanding, and will. A Book, or Board, or Stone, cannot be a person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:30732:124"/> nor will: every thing that hath life, is not a person.</p>
                        <p>And this is one reason (as <hi>Zanchy</hi> notes) why the Latine Churches do call the Father, Son, and holy Ghost (persons) rather than (Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences or Hypostases) <hi>viz.</hi> Because things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life and reason, may be called subsistences; Stones, and Beasts are Subsistences, so the Sun, and Moon, and stars, &amp;c.

                        <p>Hence also the Grecians themselves (as the same Author notes) have imitated the Latines, and have said, <hi>esse unam <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, in the person; And so the holy Ghost is also in effect called a person, when Christ saith he will send another Comforter, <hi>q. d.</hi> not the Fathers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor the Sons; but another Person distinct from both. Yet this distinction of the persons, is only Personal, not Essential, the Essence of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is one and the same; But the Persons are divers, several, single and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct; in the blessed Trinity, there is <hi>alius</hi> and <hi>alius;</hi> but not, <hi>aliud</hi> and <hi>aliud;</hi> Another, and another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; but not another and another thing.

                        <p>Then (according to this description of a person)
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:30732:124"/> when I say the Father, Son, and holy Ghost are persons, I mean, that they are single and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able substances, subsisting of themselves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Stock</hi> calls the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons three Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his Sermons upon 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7.

                        <p>The second Proposition is, that the Father, Son, and holy Ghost are Persons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Father is a person, or substance, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of himself; We read of his subsistence, or person, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. Here Christ is called the Image of his Fathers person, to shew that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a person.

The Holy Ghost did appear in a visible shape, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. and this shews he is a Person, not a mere Name, or Quality, or Property, but a single Substance. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Properties and Works of the Holy Ghost shew, that he is a Rational, and living Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.

                        <p>Thus I have proved the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to be Persons. I shall prove them all to be Eternal Persons, when I come to prove them to be God.

                        <p>That the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are not One Person, but Three several Persons. Though One God, yet not One Person.

The Father is not the Son, nor is he the Holy Ghost: the Son is not the Father, nor is he the Holy Ghost: the Holy Ghost is not the Father, nor is he the Son.

                           <hi>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God even our Father.</hi> My Text saith plainly, they are three witnesses, <hi>Three that bear record in heaven;</hi> and names them particularly; and they are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly mentioned in divers Scriptures, and put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14.</p>
                        <p>It appears they are three Persons, by their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal, and incommunicable Properties.

I will onely note a Similitude which S. <hi>Austin</hi> useth about the Trinity. The Spring (saith he) and River, and a portion taken out of these, are three distinct things: but if any man shall ask, What is the Spring? you answer, Water: What is the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Water: What is the portion taken out? Water. Again: Come to a Well (saith he) fill three Cups with water, we can say they are three, yet not three waters, but the same water, and three Cups of water. So in the Trinity, there are not three Natures, or three Essences, but three Persons. But to whom shall we liken God? or with what shall we compare him? All things and words fall short of expressing him.</p>

                        <p>It was <hi>Luthers</hi> distinction, That the works of the Trinity are to be considered absolutely as they are God, and relatively as they are Persons. As they are God, the works which they do, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to every Person; so the Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, Create, Redeem, and Sanctifie together; they work all together; their works <hi>ad extra</hi> are undivided; the works which the blessed Trinity do work without themselves, are done by every Person as really, as by one.

                        <p>Yet this difference is onely <hi>Quoad ordinem sive modum operandi; non quoad vim causalem quam exercent:</hi> A difference of Order, not of Power; for every Person works from himself, not from another, in respect of their Divine power; for all are God, even One Eternal power and God-head, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20.

                        <p>Thus the blessed Trinity must be owned in their Works, and in the manner of their Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in their distinct Offices, which they have mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually agreed from Eternity to take upon them severally for mans happiness; as One to be the proper Creator, another to be the proper Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, another to be the proper Sanctifier of our Souls.

Submit to every Law, and Ordinance, and Precept of the blessed Trinity: look upon those things with a special eye of Obedience, that are commended to you under the reverend name of the whole Trinity. For instance, we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe in Jesus Christ, by the whole Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and if we believe not, we give the lie to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; who all bear witness to the Doctrine concerning faith in Christ, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 6, 7, 9. Again: we have the Doctrine of Baptism, and the Ordinance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism commended to us by the blessed Trinity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Baptising them in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi> Moreover: The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Gospel-Ministry, is expresly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by the blessed Trinity; and to slight this Office, is to sleight the blessed Trinity. <hi>He that despiseth you, despiseth me, and him that sent me:</hi>
                           <pb n="231" facs="tcp:30732:132"/> That is, the Father, and the Son; the First, and Second Person in the Trinity: And the Holy Ghost is not excluded; for he also commends to the Church, this Office; and wrote the Scripture wherein this office is taught; yea, names himself as the Author and Owner of this Office, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>The Holy Ghost hath made you over-seers, to feed the Church of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2, 3, 4. <hi>The Holy Ghost said, Separats me Barnabas and Saul, for the work,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands upon them, they sent them away. So they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c. Those whom men had sent forth with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands, are here said to be sent forth by the Holy Ghost. So that the Office of the Ministry, is an Ordinance of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: and this is that One Law-giver, who hath power to save, and to destroy. Therefore if you love your souls, or your God; if you fear the blessed Trinity, do not despise Baptism, and the Ministry, or any other Ordinance: For if you do, God will require it, the blessed Trinity will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage against you; and it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. If a man sin presumptuously against the Lord, Who shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for him?</p>
                        <p>If a man should sin against God the Father, and God the Holy Ghost onely, here were some hope still, so long as God the Son is become a mans friend to God, and a blessed Mediatour for him: But if a man lose the Favour of Christ too, What will become of that man to Eternity? Its a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Trinity: a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to have the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:30732:133"/> engaged to the uttermost against a mans soul. What ever you do, do not sin wilfully and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the blessed Trinity. Do not despise that Ordinance, nor speak against that Ordinance, nor neglect that Ordinance, which comes unto you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, lest you perish in your sin, and dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy. Wo to him that striveth with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: and much more wo to him that striveth with his Maker and Redeemer, and Comforter at once.</p>
                        <p>Therefore take your Bibles, and read, and search, and observe, what Laws and Ordinances are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly signed with the whole name of the Glorious Trinity; and set your selves with all your might, and all your souls, to the Conscionable observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and practice of them; that the blessing of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, may be upon your souls for ever. Thus much to the third Principle.</p>

                        <p>1. The Christians God is that famous God of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> the God of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Isaac, Jacob,</hi> the God of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, the God of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Rom. 3. 29, 30. <hi>Is he the God of the Jews onely? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also.</hi> Christ himself pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that the God which the Jews did confess, was his Father, <hi>John</hi> 8. 54. Christ and his Apostles do own that Rule of worship, which God establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed among the Jews, <hi>viz.</hi> the Old Testament, and do prove all their Doctrine by the Jews Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>John</hi> 5. 46. <hi>Moses wrote of me.</hi> See further, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22. to the end.</p>
                        <p>Now this God of the Hebrews is the onely true God, and therefore our God whom we serve, is so. This God hath confirmed himself to be the onely true God, in all Ages, by signs, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and mighty deeds. This was he that did all the Miracles and Wonders in <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 7. 16, 17. <hi>Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews,</hi> &amp;c. Of the truth of all those glorious Miracles which God did by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken formerly in my discourse of the Scriptures, whereto I now referr you. Onely take notice here, that the Jews and we differ not about the Identity and Sameness of that God which spake by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets, nor about the Creator of the world, but about the Mediator, Jesus Christ, and about the Persons in this God, which
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:30732:134"/> yet we defend to be the truth, and confirm it by their Bible, <hi>viz.</hi> the Old Testament. For they and we have one Rule, but they are blinded that they understand it not; they have the true Law of God among them, but they have not kept it, nor observed it as they should, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Unto them were committed the oracles of God.</hi> Acts 7. 38. 53. <hi>Who received the lively oracles to give unto us.</hi> And again, <hi>Who have receiv'd the law by the disposition of Angels, and have not kept it.</hi> Tis true, the Jews and Christians differ about the sense of their Law, but that Christ gave the true sense, and they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Now that the God of the Hebrews is a true God, is confessed by the writings of the wisest Philosopers, As <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Plato, Seneca:</hi> yea, by the Historians, and Poets; yea, the very Oracles of the Heathens themselves: as <hi>Du Plessis</hi> discourseth at large in his twenty first Chapter, where he proposeth the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and a Verse of the Sybils, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:30732:134"/> they own the Israelites, the Hebrews and their Religion. These Sibyls were ten wise women, which were counted Fortune-tellers, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to know the counsels of their God, or their Idol <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and one of these, <hi>viz.</hi> the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Sybil, wrote six hundred Oracles of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ.

So say
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:30732:135"/> I, the God that can do the greatest works, let him be my God.

                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:30732:138"/>
                        <p> All the gods in the world may be divided into two ranks, either those before Christ, or those since Christ.</p>
                        <p>1. Before Christ: the Gods of the Gentiles, the <hi>Grecians, Romans, Barbarians, Chaldeans, Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> &amp;c. As for those of the <hi>Chaldeans, Syrians,</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who worshipped the Sunne, and Moon, and Birds, and four footed beasts, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of such Gods is sufficient confutation of them, as the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 23. But those Gods of the wisest Heathens, the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> the fame wereof have spread over the world for many ages, these I shall prove to be no Gods, but Idols, Images, and Devils.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> differed little in their superstitions. They had both their two sorts of Gods, Principal, and lesser Gods. The <hi>Romans</hi> worshipped twenty Principal Gods, the <hi>Grecians</hi> but twelve of them, <hi>viz. Jupiter, Saturn, Bacchus, Apollo, Mars, Minerva, Diana, Venus, Juno, Ceres, Mercurius, Vulcan.</hi> Hence the Altar of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> was called, <gap reason="foreign">

A God for Thunder, another for Time, another for Wine, another for Physick, another for War, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Wisedom, another for Hunting, another for Beauty, another for Riches, another for Corn, another for Eloquence, another for Fire. Yea, they had their He Gods, and Shee Gods, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fancies: their Cradle Gods, and their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Gods; their Houshold Gods, and their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Gods, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p> But for their Principal Gods, were they Gods indeed, or Idols?</p>
                        <p>1. They were men, yea, the worst of men, and dyed like men, and therefore no Gods. This was the Argument that <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> used to convince those amongst whom they lived, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Juno, Jupiter, Neptune,</hi> were <hi>Saturns</hi> off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, and therefore they were men; and if men, then born of men, and their geneologies are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by their own writers; yea, they were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the grossest vices, as Adultery, Theft, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Drunkennesse, &amp;c. as their own Poets and Prophets witnesse; yea, not onely Poets, but their gravest writers, <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi> name their vices.

                        <p>They were Devils that gave the Answers, and were worshipped in those images, and under the names of those dead men before mentioned; and when they were asked by their worshippers, who they were? they said in their own Oracles, they were dead men. <hi>Apollo</hi> was worshipped at <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos,</hi> and when they asked, what he was? the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle answers, The son of <hi>Latonia;</hi> and <hi>Esculapius</hi> was the son of <hi>Apollo, Mercury</hi> the son of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Maia, &amp;c.</hi> as we see in other Oracles. And that they were Devils in the images of men, is attested by many of their own writers, which St. <hi>Austin, Du Plessis,</hi> and others, prove at large.

St. <hi>Austin</hi> hath a whole chapter upon this passage of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes:</hi> the summe is this. <q>Man is the Maker of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:30732:139"/> the gods that dwell in Temples: man then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth images after his own likeness, whereto he calleth spirits by art of Magick, or else they come into them of their own accord, and foretel unto men things to come: and in very deed (saith he) <hi>Esculapius,</hi> the grand father of <hi>Asclepius,</hi> and <hi>Mercury▪</hi> mine own grand father, which are worshipped at <hi>Hermopolis</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> were men, whose bodies lie, the one in <hi>Libya,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Hermopolis:</hi> and under their names are worshipped certain Devils, whom I allured and drew into their images.</q> Yea, <hi>Leon</hi> the High Priest of <hi>Egypt,</hi> being asked secretly concerning the original of their gods, told <hi>Alexander,</hi> that all the great gods which the <hi>Romans</hi> called The gods of the greater nations, were all of them men, and bid him to conceal it. I might adde something concerning the falseness, and doubtfulness, and wickednesse of some of their Oracles, and how they require men to Sacrifize their Sons and Daughters, which shews from whence these O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles came, as the Scripture pleads against them. <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 37, 38. <hi>They Sacrifized their Sons and their Daughters to the Idols of</hi> Canaan. So they were Men, and Devils speaking in the Images of Men. The Devils made them to worship dead Men, or rather Devils themselves, speaking in Mens names. That's the first thing.</p>
                        <p>2. These Gods were many, and therefore false Gods, no Gods: for God must needs be one; And to this not only the Scriptures, but also the wisest of Heathens and Philosophers give witness; Though the ignorant multitude of the Gentiles, did worship a multitude of Gods, yet the wiser

Omit the barbarous senselessenesse of it (for he could neither write nor read) He promises to his followers, a Paradise where they should have all carnal pleasure, *enjoy women, lye upon silken <note place="margin">See <hi>Dr. Preston</hi> upon the <hi>Attr.</hi>

He was a notorious Adulterer, which he himself confess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> pretending a License from God, in such odious words, as I am ashamed to repeat. You may read more of this false Religion (Mahumetanism) in <hi>Rosses</hi> view of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world, lately printed in English, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in <hi>Du Plessis,</hi> and other learned writers. How far is this impure Doctrine from that holiness, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, self-denyal, heavenly mindedness, and Communion with God in this life, and that to come, which is taught by Jesus Christ?</p>
                        <p>Yea he promiseth the Readers of his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that whoever readeth this Book a thousand times, he shall have a woman in Paradise with eyebrows as wide as the Rainbow, and such other ridiculous and wanton whimzies, and Chimaeras.</p>
                        <p>3. By his Jealousie of his own Doctrine: for he will have none to examine it, or dispute of it, upon pain of death. Good mony (no doubt) that

The Christians God is the only Author, and end of the Scripture; and therefore the only true God. <hi>Ps.</hi> 147. 19, 20. <hi>He shewed his word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>&amp;c. He hath not dealt so with any Nation; and as for his Judgments they have not known them. q. d.</hi> The Gods of other Nations could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent such a Rule for them. <hi>Luc.</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>That thou maist know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed. q. d.</hi> There goes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of God and of Christ, what he did, what wonders he hath wrought in the world, and the Scripture is written that men may be <hi>certain.</hi> The Scripture pleads for the Christians God, and owns no other Father or Author, and rejects all other Gods, calling them Idols, false Gods; vanities, Lies, abominations; and advances that one God which made the Heavens and all things therein.</p>
                        <p>Now I have before proved the Authority of this book, and that there are things in it of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural invention, high conceptions beyond the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:30732:142"/> reach of any Creature, proceeding from the mind of the only Creator of all things; and therefore the Scripture is a competent Judge, and Rule of discerning the true God from all other.</p>
                        <p>The Prophecies, the Miracles, the Holinesse, the Purity, the power, the omnisciency, the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Comforts, the Majestie, the Mysteries of Scripture, do all joyn hand in hand, and unite forces to maintain the incomparable and divine Authority of this book; and it designs the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of the Christians God, and debasing of all other; but enough of these before.</p>
                        <p>Lay all this together, The Christians God is the Famous God of the Hebrews, hath all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable properties of the true God; hath done the works of the true God; and all other Gods are Idols, Images, and Devils; yea the Christians God is the only one God, admits of no equal; and is the Author of supernatural Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Laws; and it clears our eyes, as the Sun at noon day, to see and understand this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>viz.</hi> That the God of the Christians is the true God, and there is no other God.

                        <p n="1">1. The Unity of Faith, the One-nesse of true Religion, one God, one Faith: If there be but one true God, then there can be but one true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: There are multitudes of Religions set on foot, but all are false but only one. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:30732:143"/> what is Religion but a serving of the true God with our Souls and Bodies in a right manner? <hi>Ro.</hi> 12. 1. God is the only object of true Religion, a man cannot have a Religion without a God, and therefore if his God prove to be no God, his Religion will prove to be no Religion, but Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Superstition, and vanity. And thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle reasons against the Gentiles before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Christians, when he tells them that when they were without Christ, they were without God in the World, and so without hope, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Having no hope, and without God in the World.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. The Truth of Christian Religion; Christians have a true God, and they serve him in a true and right manner, and therfore they have the only true Religion. Three things make up true Religion.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The True object, which is God, even the true God, and this the Christian hath, and in this exceeds all Heathens, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Yee turned to God from Idols, to serve the living and true God.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. A true and sufficient Mediator, which is Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ who is both God and Man, and so the chiefest among ten thousands for such a purpose, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. Here the Christians privilege is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Jew.</p>

                        <p>3. The reason of Sincerity; The Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion stands much in heart-service, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians God saith to him, My Son give me thy Heart: and the right Christian prizeth Sincerity, aims at it, and can pray with <hi>David,</hi> O let my Heart be sound in thy Statutes: and whats the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?

Thus Coverous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and minding Earthly things is Idolatry. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Whose God is their belly, who mind Earthly things. Col.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>And Covetousnesse which is Idolatry.</hi> Christians are ordinarily free from grosse Idolatry, because there is light enough in the Church to see the vanity of Idols, and false Gods; but most are intangled with the later kind, <hi>viz.</hi> secret Idolatry, cleaving to Creatures, Friends, Riches, (especially in a straight) more than to the All-sufficient Creator.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Take heed of Superstition and false worship, for the true God must be worshipped in truth, and in a right manner; according to his own word and will, not the Commandements of Men. Jews and Papists worship the true God, yet not truly, but with a false worship, dishonouring the Mediatour and the Rule of <hi>viz.</hi> Christ, and the Scriptures, and intruding their own traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                        <p>That the first man was the first sinner among men: he was the first man that sinned: he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fell from his first estate, and first goodnesse. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 13. Adam <hi>was first formed.</hi> He was the first man. And we read of his Sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. and many other scriptures, especially, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14. Adam's <hi>transgression. Job</hi> 31. 33. <hi>If I covered my transgression as</hi> Adam. Then <hi>Adam</hi> was a Transgressor, and he was the first transgressor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, for he is called, the first man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. <hi>The first man</hi> Adam. Indeed the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:30732:146"/> Devil was a Sinner before him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. And so was <hi>Eve</hi> his wife a Sinner before him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. But among men he was the first: he was the first man that ever sinned against God.</p>
                        <p>And this was his Sin; God gave him a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement that he should not eat of the Tree of Knowledge (which was a Sacrament of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works) but he by the temptation of Satan, and perswasion of his wife, wilfully brake the Commandement of God, and eat of that forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit; As appears in the history of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1, 7. Compared with Chap. 2. 16. 17.</p>
                        <p>And though this Sin was finished in the very act of eating: yet the first motion and degree of this Sin did necessarily precede, and go before the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act of eating, so that the man might be rightly said to have been a Sinner before he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the act, for he was a Sinner in heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in yielding to the Tempter: and this St. <hi>James</hi> calls, the Conception of Lust which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth Sin, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 15. Hence the very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and longing desire of <hi>Eve,</hi> towards the fruit of the Tree, is exactly noted as her first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>A Tree to be desired.</hi> She eat it in her heart before, as our Saviour saith of one that lusts after a woman, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 28. <hi>He hath committed Adultery already in his heart.</hi> So <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> sinned in heart first, and then in act afterwards.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the chief cause of this Sin was man himself, by the abuse of his own free-will, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 29. <hi>He found out many inventions.</hi> He inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and contrived his own ruine; In the pride of his heart, he would set himself in the Throne of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:30732:146"/> God, and would be as God himself; And to carry on this cursed design of his Ambitious will, he would make tryal, whether the forbidden fruit had any vertue or power in it, to conferre such dignity or preferment upon him: for this was the main Argument in the Temptation which prevailed with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil.</hi> 'Tis spoken in the plural number, which shews that Satan spake as well to the man as the woman, though he began with her, and prevailed with her first.</p>
                        <p>I say <hi>Adam's</hi> will was first corrupted before he had actually sinned, for neither Satan nor the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man could compel him, but only tempt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him; And God had forbidden the Sin, and therefore did only permit it; Therefore God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Cause &amp; Author of it; Neither did he impose a necessity upon man to Sin, but made him able to stand if he would: his will was made free, and indifferent to the choice of good or evil; He was made righteous, and he might have continued so if he would: according to that received Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, <hi>accepit posse, si vellet; Non autem velle, ut posset, He received power to stand, if he would; But not power so to will, as to stand unchangeably.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The aggravations of this first Sin, are those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sins that are womb'd up in it. 1. There was Pride in it, for man desired an Equality with God. 2. Unbelief, for he believed the Devil ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than God, who had threatned him with death. 3. Idolatry, for he worshiped himself, and made himself, yea Satan, a God, his Idol, and prefers him to God. 4. Theft, for he rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed God (the Author and Owner of the Tree of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:30732:147"/> Knowledge) of his fruit, took it against his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. 5. Intemperance, for he was not satisfied with a free liberty to eat of all the other Trees in Paradise. 6. Unthankfulnesse, for his being, and well-being which he received from his maker, yet slighting and contemning such a God, yea pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring an Apple to him. 7. An open profession of Rebellion and Apostasy from God, in violating the solemn Sacrament, and token of the Covenant betwixt God and him, <hi>viz.</hi> The Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. 8. Lastly, Unnatural and cruel murder of his whole posterity: for he was a publick person, and was intrusted with the privileges of all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, either to keep or to lose them for himself and for all his, even those many Generations that should issue from him in all ages to the end of the world.</p>
                        <p>Therefore <hi>Adam's</hi> first Sin was no small fault; But a prodigious horrible transgression, attended with that folly and madness, which wants a name to express it, and justly deserves that wrath and punishment which attends it.</p>
                        <p>All these Concomitant vices which are joyned with the first transgression, do shew clearly, that <hi>Adam's</hi> will was become unrighteous, and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously corrupted in his fall: For how could he be proud, and unbelieving, and an Idolater, and chuse the Devil for his Counsellour, against his will? How could he be a Thief, be intemperate, and unthankful, against his will? Yea, how could he profess himself an open Rebel against his Creator, and murder his whole posterity, and make them subject to eternal death, against his will? How could be take and eat of the fruit which he knew to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:30732:147"/> be forbidden, against his will? Yea, how could he hide his transgression afterward, and shift it off to the woman; yea lay the blame upon God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, against his will? <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>The woman whom thou gavest me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis clear, the main fault was in his will, and the man had a plot in hand, and his great design was, to advance himself, to be equal with God, and this was his proud will.</p>

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:30732:148"/> so <hi>Adam</hi> was himself, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 49.</p>
                        <p>Note by the way, that <hi>Adam</hi> was not the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Image of God, as Christ is of the Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. But a created moral Image, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of some qualities, &amp; motions wrought in him by his maker, to represent in some sort the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature; Righteousnesse and holinesse were implanted in him; as we may draw an Image of a living man in a piece of stone or timber, and call it the Image or likeness of a living man; Yet it is not a living man, not hath it any part of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in it: So man had some of the Communicable Properties of God, as wisdom, goodness, &amp;c. Yet none of his incommunicable Attributes, as Christ had. <hi>Col</hi> 5. 9.</p>
                        <p>For if he had partook of the substance and essence of God, he should have been God, as Christ is, and so could never have lost the image of God; but his fall shews it a changeable image.</p>
                        <p>2. He lost Communion with God, he hides himself from God, and is afraid of him after the fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8. and vers. 24. <hi>He drove out the man, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Otherwise <hi>Adam</hi> would have had no need of Christ to be a Mediator for him, if he had not lost Communion with God. <hi>John</hi> 14. 6.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>No man,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>cometh unto the Father but by me.</hi> If no man, then not <hi>Adam</hi> the first, and greatest sinner, the immediate Author of his own ruine.

                        <p>3. He lost his freedom, to will or do that which
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:30732:148"/> was good, and became a slave to the world, flesh, and Devil, which appears not only by his first Sin, wherein he was overcome by Satan, and his Wife, and an Apple; but also it is manifest by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all his Posterity, who are thus in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of darknesse.

                        <p>4. He lost the comfort and blessing of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enjoyments and riches, he enjoys them now with a curse. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Cursed is the ground for thy sake, in sorrrw shalt thou eat of it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>5. He lost immortality of body: for death and sicknesse came in by sin; Text, <hi>Death by Sin;</hi> Which shews he had not dyed, if he had not sinned; and that Promise must needs be implyed in the threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely dye,</hi> that is, if thou eat not of it thou shalt surely live, and not dye; and that was signified to him in the tree of Life. Yet seeing man dyed not on that day which he sinned, tis clear, a spiritual death was chiefly intended in the threatning, and a spiritual life was chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Promise; and also, that man should become a mortal and subject to temporal death the very day that he sinned; As God himself doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21. <hi>By man came Death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. He lost eternal life of Soul, or eternity of spiritual life, and became subject to eternal death. He was driven out from the Sacrament or Token of eternal life and Soul-blessedness, the tree of life,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:30732:149"/> which typed out the of life glory in Heaven; and therefore Christ calls Heaven Paradise, because it represented Heaven, <hi>Luc.</hi> 23. 42, 43.

                        <p>Besides, <hi>Adam</hi> was a publick person, the root of all man-kind, and therefore what he did, all have done with him, and what was imputed to him, was imputed to all: Thus by the Law of <note place="margin">Jure Haredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio.

                        <p>The reason is, because (as I said before) our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam</hi> was a Common and Publick person; As Christ was a publick person instead of all the Spiritual Generation, So <hi>Adam</hi> was a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Person in behalf of all the Natural Generation.

                        <p>This Hereditary and Natural Corruption is universal; spreads it self throughout the whole man; and by it men are dead in Sin, and wholly defiled in all the faculties and parts of Soul and Body. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 5, 6. <hi>Ro.</hi> 7. 18. &amp; <hi>Ro.</hi> 3. 9, 10,—21.</p>

                        <p>Now he that shall narrowly observe the end and aims of a Moral heathen in his actions, shall finde that the Gentiles respected more the praise and applause of men, than the glory of God: their works are <hi>splendida peccata,</hi> shining sins.</p>

                        <p>One that putteth himself, as a middle person, between two parties at variance, to make them friends; or to reconcile them one to the other.

                        <p>Breach of Covenant on mans part, whereby man is becom the party offending, and God the party offended. Man is a Covenant-breaker, a Transgressour of the first Law, or that Covenant of works which God and he agreed upon in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi> Gen. 2. 17. <hi>Thou shalt not eat thereof, in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely dye.</hi> q. d. <hi>(Levit.</hi> 18. 5.) Do this and live; obey my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and live; break it, and dye the death. This law God and man agree too; at first, as to a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, wherein God ingageth himself to one part, and Man himself to the other part. Mans part is obedience, Gods part is to give life upon obedience.</p>
                        <p>But Man performs not his part, but proved dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, and so the Covenant is broken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>By one mans disobedience,</hi> &amp;c. You have the whole story of his disobedience to God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. But I have treated of it before in the fifth Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And now God is wrathfully and justly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and his justice threatens man with eternal death by the curse of the Law. Hence all men are called children of wrath by nature, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. And now the wretched transgressor is lost to eternity, if there be no Mediatour. But, blessed be God, when we were enemies to him, we were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him by the death of his Son. Christ inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

                              <p>1. The Scepter or Government is long since departed from <hi>Judah;</hi> Therefore the Mediator is come long ago. For tis prophesied that he should come before the departure of the Government out of the line of <hi>Judah.</hi> In that old prophecie of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 49. 10. <hi>Until Shilo come.</hi> That is, until the Peace-maker, or Mediator come, for <hi>Shilo</hi> is derived of <hi>[Shalah]</hi> which signifieth both <note place="margin">Annotat. upon the place.</note> to be great and peaceable, and also to make peace; and this text in the sense of all Israel, and of the Jewish interpreters themselves, is a prophecie of the Messiah, the Anointed of God, the Saviour of the world; and <hi>Du Plessis</hi> names the most famous <hi>Rabbies</hi> thus expounding it.</p>

This <hi>Herod</hi> slew <hi>Hircanus</hi> the last King of the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> And ever since to this day the Jews have been Out-casts, their Common-weal dissolved, their Government bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces, and they dispersed and scattered into several Countries, without any Governour or Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver of their own Nation, and are wholy in the power of those Princes, or Potentates or States, in whose Land they live.

                                 </gap>ir Talmud are recorded several Traditions concerning the time of the <hi>Messiah</hi>'s coming; Some set the time about the destruction of the Temple, as the School of <hi>Elias:</hi> Others about the time of <hi>Herod:</hi> Some in the year of the world 4474: Others in the year of the world 5118.

In the conclusion, after much alteration and changing of the time, and much expectation to no purpose, their greatest Rabbins come to this point, That it is needless to calculate any more for the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> That all the times limited by the Prophets are already past; And they have found out this shif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>And how unlikely and senselesse is that shift of the Jews, that the Disciples should steal him away, when so strong a Guard was set, and <hi>Pilat</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self believed that he was risen?

                              <p>IV. His Prophecies prove him to be the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> or Mediatour. The Jews themselves expound <hi>Moses</hi> Prophecie of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that he should be a great Prophet <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 18. Whence arose that Common demand in the Gospel, Art thou that Prophet? Not to mention Christ divining about the thoughts of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi> and how he knew the hearts of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; I will propose his Prophecies, of the spreading of the Gospel in all Nations, of his own Resurrection, of the Persecutions of his Apostles, of the Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> of the great Wars, Commotions, and tumults that should be in the world after his Death <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the Destruction of the Temple, that there should not be left one stone upon another, and that forty years before it came to passe. And this was done by <hi>Titus</hi> atd <hi>Vespasian,</hi> as their own Histories declare at large. Yea, he prophecyeth of the besieging of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the taking thereof, and their banishment into all Nations. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 21, 24.</p>
                              <p>But I have spoken largely of Prophecies in my Doctrine of the Scripture, and will therefor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten to another Proof.</p>

                              <p>V. The purity of his Doctrine, proves him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> or Mediator, for he grounds all his sayings upon Scripture, and advanceth the Glory of God, and teacheth self-denyal, Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:30732:161"/> of heart, contempt of the world, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the Law, as cheking the lusts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions of the Soul; Condemns the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cricy of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> who interpreted the Law to extend only to the outward man, and outward worship, but He carries it home with Power to the hidden man of the heart. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 27, 28, &amp;c. Yea in his Doctrine he revealeth Mysteries beyond the reach of Man <hi>Joh.</hi> 1: 18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15, 15. As the Doctrine of his One-ness with the Father, his equality with God, his being in heaven when he was upon earth, and the Prophecies before named, to which I might adde, the institutions of new Sacraments, abolishing the old, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of Apostles and Ministers in the Church; appointment of a more special worship, and more spiritual Sabbath. All which are supernatural Conceptions; yea his incomparable Holinesse, impartial Severity, wherein he will not allow men in one unknown sin, except they mean to perish for ever.</p>
                              <p>Now his Doctrine joyned to his Miracles, and Prophecies, confirm the verity of his office beyond Contradiction: for Doctrine is the touchstone of all Miracles and Prophecies. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34. <hi>He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God.</hi>

                              </p>
                              <p>Quest. 5. <hi>How doth Christ perform this Office?</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Answ.</hi> According to his several undertakings, mentioned in the fourth question. His perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance is suitable to his undertaking 1. He. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:30732:164"/> the Satisfaction. 2. The Reconciliation, and Covenant. 3. The Confirmation of all.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. The Satisfaction is performed by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to death, his whole obedience, both active and passive obedience; Whatever he did or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the flesh was for man, and for satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Gods Justice on mans behalf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>By the obedience of One, shall many be made right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous. Phil.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, &amp;c.</hi> For whom? Not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for he was equal to God, and had glory e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough before, and needed not to do any thing to <note place="margin">Calvin Instit.</note> make him more happy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 5. For whom then did he satisfy, and merit by all his doing and suffering? For our sakes only, not at all for his own, <hi>Isay</hi> 9. 6. <hi>To us a Son is born.</hi> To us, to us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 19. <hi>For their sakes, I sanctify my self. Ro.</hi> 8. 32. <hi>Delivered him up for us all.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>By his Passive obedience he satisfies Justice so far, as to free us from the curse of the Law, and the punishment of Sin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                              <p>By his Active obedience he satisfyes further, Even so as to merit eternal life for us, by fulfilling the Law, which requires perfect obedience, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising life upon obedience; For man by disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, did not only incurre the penalty of death, but also he forfeited the reward of life, or unto life, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 25. Now Christ by his active obedience, hath merited eternal life for those that had made an absolute forfeiture, <hi>Ro.</hi> 5. 18. chap. 6. 23. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 11, 14. <hi>Purchased possession.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Two things are required to the satisfaction of Gods justice: 1. Suffering the punishment due to the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:30732:165"/> breach of the Law, and 2. Perfect righteousness in fullfilling the Law. Now if Christ had only suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us, he had left us only in <hi>Statu quo prius,</hi> in the same condition we were in before the fall, and we could not have been saved without perfect obedience to the Law, but now that he hath full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Law for us, believing in him will bring us to life, though our obedience be imperfect.</p>
                              <p>Yet Christs active and passive obedience are not divided, but both are united in the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and there is merit in both; But the <note place="margin">

                              <p>And though we may not divide his obedience into parts: yet we must distinguish it, in respect of the end thereof, for it looks two wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> To a double satisfaction: it designs the satisfying of God for two things. 1. For the punishment due to man. 2. For eternal life which man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of God. The first, it satisfies by suffering. The latter, by perfect righteousness, or fulfilling of the Law. And thus the death and passion of Christ, is principally referred to his passive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and the fulfilling of the Law, to his active obedience; Otherwise <hi>Adam's</hi> disobedience would be more meritorious to Damnation, than Christs obedience to Salvation.</p>
                              <p>This satisfactory obedience of Christ, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:30732:165"/> in it the whole Doctrine of his Incarnation, Life, and Death, Resurrection, and Ascension, of which I will not now treat particularly; Only I do profess my Faith in these points, according to the Scriptures, and the Ancient Creed, <hi>viz.</hi>
                                 <q>That Jesus Christ our Lord was conceived by the Holy-Ghost, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> suffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was Crucified, Dead, and Buried, He descended into Hell, the third day he rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <note place="margin">That is into Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, as <hi>Calvin,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 38.</note> from the dead, He ascended into Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                                 </q> And thus he not only satisfied Gods just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, but also he made it manifest, he was both called and qualified to this office of Mediator, <hi>viz.</hi> By his Resurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Thus much to the performance of the first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, <hi>viz.</hi> Satisfaction.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The Reconciliation is performed by appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Satisfaction, both to God and men: and so, by Intercession, and effectual perswasion or vocation.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Christ applyes his Satisfaction to God by Intercession, <hi>Isay.</hi> 53. 12. <hi>He bare the sin of many, and made Intercession for the Transgressors. Rom.</hi> 8. 34. <hi>It is Christ that died,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who also maketh Intercession for us.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Thus he did on earth, and thus he doth in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. Throughout, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 4. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
                              <p>Yet I do not conceive that Christs praying, and interceding in Heaven is like ours, or his own on earth, not with cryes and tears, as on earth; But it is only a Glorious appearing in the presence of his Father for us, with the merits of his satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, urged in some unspeakable manner of propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,

                              <p n="2">2▪ Christ applyes his Satisfaction to men, by perswading them to accept of him as Mediator, and of peace with God by him; And that both by external, and internal vocation; And so he makes us willing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 16, 17. <hi>That he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>Thus Christ performs the Reconciliation, and in the same manner he performs the Stipulation, and draws man into Covenant with God: he perswads us effectually to enter into Covenant, for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Reconciliation are one in effect; Hence the Covenant is called, a Covenant of peace, and Christ is called, the messenger of the Covenant, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                              <p>Therefore I will speak no more to the manner of performing the Stipulation, but will passe to the Confirmation of this peace.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. The Confirmation of peace is performed, by Intercession to God continually, and by fresh sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes of Grace to man, and by frequent renewing
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:30732:166"/> and sealing the Covenant, with the outward and inward seals thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> The Sacraments, and the spirit of Grace, 1. <hi>John</hi> 2. 1. <hi>If any man sin, we have an advocate,</hi> &amp;c.

                              <p>Object. <hi>But the party offended cannot be Mediator. Christ, as he is God, is the party offended: Therefore He cannot be mediator.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. The major Proposition is true; if the <note place="margin">Urfine.</note> party offended be such a one, as in whom there are not more Persons than one: but in God is a Trinity of Persons, as is before shewed; Therefore in him one Person may become Mediatour to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                              <p>2. The Persons offended being more than one, one of them may be Mediator, though not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <note place="margin">Dr. Pride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux.</note> considered as offended; yet as he doth, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam induere,</hi> he may: That is, if he put on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther form, he may. And this hath Christ done. He came in the form of a servant, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. Thus one Senatour may intercede for the guilty, to a whole Senate, without any impeachment to his dignity, and to shew his merciful disposition.

                        <p>I. <hi>Confutation.</hi> This Doctrine may serve to confute the Papists that seek to overthrow Christs Mediatorship, and that gives his glory to another. They erre two ways. 1. Against Christs satisfaction. 2. Against his Intercession; and so against all his whole Office.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Against his Merit and Satisfaction; the Romanists teach us, That we must have more Priests, and more sacrifices for sin, as the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Masse, (that detestable Idol, as the Martyrs were wont to stile it) and further, they teach the merit of works, and Purgatory, and more such idle inventions. All which corrupt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions are refuted by the Doctrine of Christs Mediatorship, and his sole interest in this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. The Scripture knows but one Mediatour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. but one high Priest under the New Testament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. but one Sacrifice or Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 27. chapt. 9. 27. chapt. 10. 10, 14. The Scripture saith plainly, There shall be no more offering for sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 18. Yea, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the old Priests were abolished, because they were men of infirmity, and but men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 28. Yea the Scripture reiects our works in point of merit, and attributes our salvation to free grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, &amp;c. <hi>Ro.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Ro.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Against Christs Intercession; they teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mediators, as the Saints deceased, and the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c. They distinguish betwixt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators of Redemption, and Mediators of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession;
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:30732:168"/> and this last Office they attribute to the Saints departed. But if we pray to them, they cannot hear us, neither know they our affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any further than God acquaints them; and did they know, they would give Christ the glory of his own Office, who ever lives to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. and there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a Mediator of Redemption, and one of Intercession; for both these belong to one office; and are peculiar to Christ. He is Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour as well as Redeemer, <hi>Isai</hi> 53. 12. and my text saith, <hi>There is one Mediatour.</hi> Besides, Why did not the Prophets and Apostles make use of such Mediators, if God were pleased with them? Why did not <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and other Saints recorded in Scripture whiles they lived in the world, apply themselves to dead Saints, and pray, Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> have mercy on us, and mediate for us? Indeed in the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. we read of one of the Fire-brands of hell, praying thus, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham,</hi> have mercy upon me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he had no other Father in heaven, and <hi>Abraham</hi> was his Father (possibly) after the flesh onely; and so tis a fleshly and hellish prayer. And though there be such prayers in hell; yet let us not learn of them to pray; lets have no such pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Church: but learn of Christ to pray to God onely, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 6, 9.</p>

                        <p>The Conclusion is, If ever you mean to be saved, you must do two things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. You must come unto Christ by faith, and so refer all the difference betwixt God and your souls to him, to take it up for you, and so suffer him to bring you to God, and to bring you into favour with God, <hi>John</hi> 6. 37. <hi>John</hi> 14. 6. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>John</hi> 5. 40.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. You must enter into Actual Covenant with
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:30732:170"/> God, and promise sincere obedience to him for the time to come, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 4, 5.</p>
                        <p>God professeth plainly his willingness to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Covenant with Sinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 16. O, take hold of the Covenant, and be at peace, <hi>Isai</hi> 56. 6, 7. <hi>Job</hi> 22. 21.</p>

                  <p>There must be building, as well as the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods House, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. but that is not my present undertaking.</p>

                  <p>Not that I do believe, that any true Christian among them was ignorant of all these Principles here mentioned; but (as I formerly noted) some were ignorant of this, and others of that, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Before I enter upon Particulars, I must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour <note place="margin">Exposition of the Text.</note> to clear the Text from a wrong sence and interpretation. For some Writers will not allow of Baptism, and Laying on of hands to be Fundamentals.</p>
                  <p>To open the words, I will propound and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swet 3. Questions.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Whether every Principle of these six in the Text be intended as Fundamental?</item>
                     <item>2. What Baptism is chiefly here intended?</item>
                     <item>3. What is meant by Laying on of hands?</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Quest. 1. <hi>Whether every Principle here enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted be a Fundamental? and so intended?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Every one of them, (even Baptism and Laying on of Hands, with the rest) is Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because other Scriptures do prove them to be so; as my following discourse shall
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:30732:178"/> manifest. And this is the rule of interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, To compare Scripture with Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>2. Because our ordinary allowed Catechisms (which are Summaries of the Fundamentals) do not leave out the Sacraments; and the old Catechism hath this phrase in it concerning the two Sacraments, <hi>They are generally neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to salvation.</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> (in his Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all Favourers of the Roman Religion) undertakes to prove, That the said Religion is against the Catholique principles of the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, that hath been agreed upon ever since the daies of the Apostles by all Churches, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming those principles of Catechism to be four, <hi>viz.</hi> The Apostles Creed, the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Lords Prayer, the Institution of the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ʋide Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> Hall <hi>Cases of Conscience, and of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</hi>
                     </note> two Sacraments, Baptism and the Lords Supper: So that Baptism is a catechetical Principle, and if Baptism, then the Office of the Ministery by which Baptism is administred.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the Sacraments are generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged (even by those Writers that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise interpret this Text) to be Marks of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Now how can that be a sufficient mark of the Church, which is not essential to the founding of it, or without which a Church may be in its constituted State?</p>
                  <p>4. Because the very Grammatical reading of the Text overthrows the contrary interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and favours my present undertaking. For these Principles are coupled together, as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Twins or pains, by a Conjunction Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:30732:179"/> set in the midst between every part, or every two Principles as they are named in order, Faith and Repentance, Baptism and Laying on of hands, Resurection and Judgement.</p>
                  <p>So instead of <hi>Piscators</hi> two single and one twin, we have found here six Principles, or three twins, which you will.</p>
                  <p>5. Here's the word (Doctrine) perfixed to the two Principles in Question, Baptism and Laying on of hands; to prevent all exception, and to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue them to be more than circumstantial, vers. 2. <hi>[Of the doctrine of baptisms, &amp;c.]</hi> referring to that doctrine of Principles above mentioned, vers. 1.</p>
                  <p>Here then the Principles are couched under 3. Heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of saving Grace, Repentance, and Faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of the means of Grace, the Sacrament and Ministry, Baptism and Laying on of hands.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of the end or reward of Grace, in the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and Eternal judgement, in all six Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the subject of my present discourse.</p>
                  <p>Quest. 2. <hi>What baptism is chiefly here intended?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This Question doth suppose that there are more Baptisms than one, and so indeed there are. There are three things which are called Baptism in the new Testament, over and besides that old Testament Type, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Martyrdom, or extraordinary suffering for the truth sake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The gift of Miracles by the power of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 5. What a great difference is betwixt this and sanctification of the Spirit, I shall shew when I come to treat particularly of Baptism.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Sacrament, or Seal of the new Covenant
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:30732:179"/> commonly called Baptism of water, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3: 11.</p>
                  <p>Now the Question is, whether of these three Baptisms is chiefly meant in my Text?</p>
                  <p>2. I affirm, that the Baptism of water is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intended as a Fundamental, though I deny not but the other two may be also included.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grounds.</hi> 1. Baptism of water is the only real and proper baptism, for there is but one proper and real baptism, without a figure, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>[one Faith, one Baptism]</hi> that is, one real baptism, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called: all other being only Metaphorical. There are indeed two figurative baptisms, <hi>viz.</hi> Martyrdom and the gift of Miracles; yet but one real and proper, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptism of water, and that only is but one, that is, but one such baptism, but one real Sacrament of baptism; one Faith, and one Baptism. The other two are no more baptism in a strict sense, than the <hi>Israelites</hi> passing through the Sea, was real baptism, which yet is called baptism, as having some resemblance to that baptism which should be in the dayes of the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2. it was only a thing like baptism, a type, another thing so called by a Metaphor.</p>
                  <p>Martyrdom is called a cup, in the same place where it is called baptism, to shew you that Christ spake by a Figure, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>The gift of Miracles is called fire, where 'tis called baptism, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. to shew that <hi>John</hi> spake of that in a Figure.</p>
                  <p>2. Baptism of water was before the other two baptisms. Baptism of water was in the dayes of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> and he Prophesies of the baptism of Miracles, which came not to passe till after
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:30732:180"/> Christs Ascension; for Christ did not so baptize immediately in his own Person on Earth, but mediately by the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4, 5. with chap. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>▪ 2, 3. <hi>Johns</hi> very phrase in his Prophecy was <hi>[baptized with the Holy Ghost;]</hi> and we know when Christ was ascended, the Holy Ghost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended to accompilsh this Prophecie, and to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill this baptism. And the baptism of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (in Christs strict meaning) began at Christs death. Baptism of water is the first of that name in Scripture, and the other two have borrowed their names of this, and cannot be understood in that notion of baptism, without relation to it, and to its Doctrine. And therefore the first and Genuine sense of the word Baptism, must relate to baptism of water in the first place, and all other baptisms do necessarily suppose baptism of water, as having a proper being before them.</p>
                  <p>Every relative hath its being <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in order to that whereto it hath relation: and so some primary literal signification is pre-required to that other of Metaphorical and Figurative; and the literal notation of the word Baptism is that of water,</p>
                  <p>Now, we must not recede from the literal and proper signification without a cogent and plain reason, and no such reason can be here urged, but the contrary, as appears by what follows.</p>
                  <p>3. The baptism of water is frequently called baptism in Scripture. The other two are seldom so called, once or twice, not commonly; but the baptism of water is called by no other name, its name is Baptism. Hence is that Rule of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> When the word (Baptism) is put alone
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:30732:180"/> (without other terms of distinction, that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily distinguish it from baptism of water) it is never put for any other thing but baptism of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for when Martyrdom is called Baptism, 'tis also called a Cup; and the gift of Miracles is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies explained by some other term, as (the Holy Ghost, and fire) to distinguish it from bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of water, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
                  <p>But here is no such term of distinction used in my Text: The word Baptism is put alone, plainly and without a Metaphor.</p>
                  <p>Though Christ calls himself a dore, <hi>John</hi> 10. yet we must not be so sencelesse as to understand Christ by every dore mentioned in Scripture, nor the Lords Supper by every cup, nor the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of Martyrdom, or of Fire, by every baptism or word (Baptism) in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>4. The other two baptisms are seldom or never called the doctrine of baptism, which is the phrase in my Text; but the baptism of water is frequently stiled either the doctrine or the preaching of baptism, in other Scriptures. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 4. <hi>[and preach the baptism, &amp;c.]</hi> So <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 3. and <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 37.</p>
                  <p>5. This baptism in my Text, is placed next to Faith and Repentance, which is the ordinany place of baptism of water in Scripture, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. Grown men were to professe faith before baptism.</p>
                  <p>6. Neither Martyrdom nor the gift of Miracles are Fundamental Doctrines; therefore baptism of water is chiefly intended in this Text.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not the baptism of the Spirit, for 'tis tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient, and ceaseth, and there have been and are
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:30732:181"/> many Christian Churches without it, as well as those Disciples were, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 1, 2, 6. were it Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental it should continue to the end, for the foundation of the Church is permanent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not the baptism of Suffering. For a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church may be without Martyrdom, but not without baptism of water ordinarily.</p>
                  <p>If Regeneration (which some good men have called the Inward baptism, and baptism of the Spirit) be any where called baptism in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is before mentioned in my text under the notion of faith and repentance: for faith and repentance is a kind of inward baptism; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that which should be joyned with baptism in men at age and years of discretion, called, the Answer of a good conscience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                  <p>I say if Regeneration be any where called bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, yet that consists in faith and repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enumerated; and we must not look for tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tology in such a <hi>compendium,</hi> and brief catalogue; if it were sufficiently mentioned before, we should not have it again in the same catalogue.</p>
                  <p>We conclude, that baptism of water is chiefly intended in this text.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But tis said, the doctrine of (baptisms) in the plural number, which implies more than one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Apostle writes to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> useth the <hi>Hebrew-</hi>phrase and manner of speech, who were wont to put the plural number for the singular, as sacrifices, for sacrifice, yea for one sacrifice, in the same Epistle, Chapt. 9. 22, 23. <hi>[better sacrifices]</hi> for, one better sacrifice <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>2. Laying on of hands upon Ministers in their ordination is chiefly (if not only) here meant.</p>
                     <p>Grounds.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because this only is properly Fundamental; a visible &amp; constituted Church may be without the other three, but not without the thing meant by this Laying on of hands in the Ordination of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, <hi>viz.</hi> the Office of the Ministry: I say the Office of the Ministry is a Fundamental; which, it is my Business to prove when I come to particulars.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Because this only is perpetual, to abide throughout all Ages, a perpetual standing Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.</p>
                     <p>Yea and this manner of Ceremony ought to continue, and doth continue to this day in the Act of ordaining; compare 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21, 22. with Chapt. 6. 13, 14.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Because the other three do all point at this, and depend upon this: they are all Ministerial Acts, and were done by Ministers, and do neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily presuppose and intend the Ministry, and stand or fall with this Office; which they know, that know the Scripture. I will only point at those places, which prove that all these Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of hands were performed by Ministers, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 14. with <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 8. and for that, upon young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, 'twas done by Christ, and he was a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, <hi>Ro.</hi> 15. 8.</p>

                     <p>By Laying on of hands (in this place of the <hi>Hebrews)</hi> is meant by a trope or borrowed Speech, the <note n="*" place="margin">R. <hi>Ʋsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Amesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, The Provincial Assembly in their Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

                     <p>Few or none (that I meet with) do account the Ceremonie it self Fundamental; but the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and office, pointed at by it; the Cup is put for the Wine in it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25. the word <hi>(cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision)</hi> is put for Christianity and Sincerity, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
                     <p>So the Phrase and Ceremony of Laying on hands, is put for the substance and office of the Ministry.</p>
                     <p>The same Apostle useth this Phrase elswhere in the same sense, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. [<gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Lay on hands suddenly on no man]</hi> that is, ordain no man, put no man into the Office of the Ministry on a suddain, without tryal of his gifts and life. So here in my Text, [<gap reason="foreign">

So you have the sense of the Text.</p>
                     <p>You see, Baptism, and Laying on of hands are intended in the number of Fundamentals: by Baptism is meant that of Water; and by Laying on hands, that of the Ministry, and the Office it self. Thus much by way of exposition.</p>
                     <p>Having expounded the Text, and made way thereby for my present purpose, I come to the particular Principles laid down in this Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Compendium or Enumeration, which are placed in this order,</p>

                        <pb n="214" facs="tcp:30732:184"/>
                        <p>The Description hath five Branches.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A turning your selves, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 32. <hi>[turn your selves]</hi> Mark 6. 12. <hi>[that men should repent]</hi> 'tis not said, that God or Christ should repent for them, but that they should do it themselves. Some fools put off all to Christ, neglect Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and say, Christ hath done all for them, and he shall repent for them. But what should Christ repent of? to bid him repent, is to charge him with Personal sin, who knew not sin; this is to blaspheme Christ; if Christ must repent for you, he must sin for you too: yea (let me tell thee) if Christ must excuse thy Personal repentance, he shall also excuse thy entrance into Heaven, and excuse you from coming thither. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 3. What impudence is this, when Christ bids you repent, you to fly in his face, and bid him do it himself! But you must turn your selves, or perish for ever.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By special Grace. Though you turn your selves, yet you are not sufficient of your selves; though it be mans own proper action, yet it is so by Gods effectual working, and by his prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace. <hi>Acti agimus,</hi> being acted, we act; being made willing, we will; being apprehended, we apprehend; being first turned, we afterward turn our selves, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 19. <hi>[surely, after that I was turned, I repented]</hi> to the same purpose, <hi>John</hi> 6. 44. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. From darknesse to light, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 8. Before a man turns to God, he loves darknesse, he loves to be ignorant of heavenly Principles, he sees no Excellency in Christ, no vanity in sin, and loves this darknesse, he is willingly ignorant, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>John</hi> 3. 19, 20. But the penitent sinner changeth
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:30732:184"/> these Principles for better, turns from darknesse to light, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. From the power of Satan, to God, <hi>Asts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>[and from the power of Satan, &amp;c.]</hi> So long as a man is impenitent he is wholy in the power of the Tempter, he committeth sin, and is the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of sin, in bondage to corruption; every temptation fetters him and chains him down in the Prison of sin; Satan hath him at his beck, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries him captive at his will; but by Repentance, the Soul recovers it self from the snares of Satan, and comes under the power of God, under the dominion of Grace; and then when Satan comes and tempts, the case is altered, and the soul makes this answer of a Free-man, What have I to do any more with sin? Satan, thou hast no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in me, no power over me, the Son of God hath made me free, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25, 26. <hi>[recover themselves, &amp;c.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Founded in Godly sorrow; the root and bottom and foundation of this holy turning, is Godly sorrow. The Soul hath now the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit of Grace upon it, and the Bowels of that mercy which it hath sinned against, begin to melt &amp; dissolve the heart into mourning, into sweet and bitter and Soul-ravishing weeping, which is unspeakable and full of true content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and blessed are the Souls that have part in it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>[Godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation] Zech.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>[I will powr upon them the Spirit of Grace, and they shall mourn, &amp;c.]</hi> and this is the true beginning of Repentance.</p>
                        <p>Repentance hath two parts.
<list>
                              <item>1. An holy purpose, not to go on in a State of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:30732:185"/> sin, but to please God, and live to God, <hi>Acts</hi> 11 23. <hi>Job</hi> 34. 31, 32. <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 1, 2, 5.</item>
                              <item>2. An holy Endeavour to perform, and this it in every one that hath any ground to hope for mercy, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. <hi>[every one, &amp;c.] Phil.</hi> 3. 14<hi>[Ipresse towards the mark, &amp;c.]</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>The design of Repentance follows.</p>
                        <p>It aimes at the favour of God, in the pardon of sin, and obtaining of Salvation by Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. <hi>[repent, for the remission of sins] Acts</hi> 3. 19. <hi>[that your sins may be blotted out]</hi> Hence 'tis cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Repentance unto life, unto salvation, as is before noted. The Prodigal saith, I will arise and go to my Father, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 15. his design is, to get into favour, yet not to merit favour.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 As the root and branch. Regeneration is the root of Repentance; Repentance the branch of Regeneration. This the habit, that the act; this the inward disposition and supernatural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the will to turn, that the turning act it self; this the seed of God, that the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring and birth of the seed; this the cause, that the effect, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 9. <hi>[his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, &amp;c.]</hi> that is, he cannot sin impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently, he cannot but repent, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 19. <hi>[after I was turned, I repented]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As original, or birth-sin is the cause of all actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al sins, so the new-birth or regeneration is the cause of all good actions:</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As the birth, and life after birth; or rather
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:30732:185"/> as Being, and action: For a Man, is not, (in a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual sence) hath no true Being, till he be born again; Regeneration is his real Being, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is his action. A Child is not author of his being, he is merely passive in it, not a doer; man is not active but passive in Regeneration; but in Repentance man is the doer, he complies with God in it, and turns himself, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>[you hath he quickned that were dead, &amp;c.]</hi> what doth a dead man do towards his own life? yet after life he acts, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>['tis God that worketh in you to do.]</hi>

                        <head type="sub">
                           <hi>Whether doth every true Penitent know the time, and other Circumstances of his first Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? is this necessary?</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> Every one that repenteth doth not know the Circumstances, neither is it necessary to know the time, place, hour, person, words, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and by which he was changed.</p>
                        <p>Though <hi>Paul</hi> and others did, and many do know these Circumstances, yet every one doth not, cannot so punctually observe them.</p>
                        <p>Proofs.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Some Penitents recorded in Scripture, have questioned and doubted whether they have been converted at all, therefore they knew not the Circumstances, who could not discern the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 50. 10, Christs Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 22. <hi>John</hi> 13. 22. Some are called, Fearfull hearts, Bruised reeds, Tremblers, Wounded spirits, Doubters, Babes, Little children, Lambs. Do Lambs remember the Yeaning day? Children the Birth day?</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="218" facs="tcp:30732:186"/> 2. Every Penitent hath not such confiderable and memorable Circumstances as some have had in their Conversion. <hi>Pauls</hi> Conversion exceeded ten thousands for Circumstances, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. a light shining, a voice from Heaven, three dayes blind, miraculous Circumstances; well might <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them. But some Penitents are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Childhood, by good Education, as <hi>Obadiah, Timothy, David, Josiah, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. 'Tis the direct Act of Faith, that puts a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinner into the state of Adoption, not the reflect Act. 'Tis believing, not assurance that saves and justifies, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>[He that believeth shall be saved]</hi> not, He only that is sure he is in the state of Salvation. Otherwise this absurd sense will be fastned upon Gods promise; He that is sure he shall be saved, he only shall be saved: which will eat out the heart and life of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and make it of none effect.</p>
                        <p>'Tis against the nature of assurance to justifie in the sight of God: for what is assurance, but a certain knowledge that I am already justified, and that I do believe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>[I know whom I have believed]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But it suits well with the nature of Adherence: For what is Adherence, but a cleaving to Christ, and casting the Soul upon him, though I am not certain, <hi>Psal.</hi> 56. 3. <hi>Job</hi> 13. 15. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 24. <hi>[Lord! I believe, help my unbelief.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Twas about the space of 24. years betwixt the time of <hi>Abrahams</hi> first believing and the time of his full assurance, as appears by the story in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> and the Circumstances therein. And 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he acted, and renewed Faith, above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:30732:186"/> times over <hi>(viz</hi> at least so often as he went to Prayer) in all that space, before he attained to that Plerophory or full assurance which the Apostle noteth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. And if a man may be truly justified by Adherence, without Assurance; then Assurance of Conversion (though it be our duty to seek it with all diligence) is yet a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege not absolutely necessary to salvation; much lesse is assurance of all circumstances so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie.</p>
                        <p>Let us make sure the main point, that we are converted, and that we are true Penitents; and let the circumstances passe to whom God will. Thus of the third question.</p>

                        <head type="sub">
                           <hi>Whether may a man be a true Penitent without any great measure of horror and amazement at his first Conversion?</hi>
                        </head>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> He may, and he needs not question the truth of his Conversion for that, if he be without such extreme fits of terror.</p>
                        <p>I grant, that conviction, godly sorrow, and deep humiliation are necessary to Conversion and true Repentance; That ordinarily some degree of fear and trembling attends every sound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, <hi>Isay</hi> 66. 2. And further, that some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts are possessed with dreadfull horror at the very instant of Conversion, as <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Gaoler, &amp;c. Yet many an upright heart may be without these extraordinary terrors at first Conversion.</p>
                        <p>Grounds.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Some Converts have had more terrors and sorrows after Conversion than before.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Abrahams</hi> horror came upon him after his Faith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 5, 6, 12.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Jobs</hi> terrors came upon him after God had pronounced him an upright man, <hi>Job.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3, 4. yet he was at ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e before, never acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such Arrows of the Almighty till now, Chapter 16. 11, 13, &amp;c. <hi>[I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder, &amp;c.]</hi> Chapt. 29. 2, 4. <hi>[O that I were, &amp;c. as I was in the daies of my youth.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Davids</hi> terrors came upon him after a foul sin; and <hi>Peters</hi> after his fall; and <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> in a great fit of sicknesse; and <hi>Davids</hi> again, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 3.</p>
                        <p>Therefore that place <hi>(Ro. v.</hi> 15.) about not receiving the Spirit of Bondage again to fear; is either no universal rule relating to the condition of all the Saints: but limited, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to the <hi>Romans,</hi> or such like case: or else we must find a better sense for it than ordinarily is fastned to it by troubled Spirits.</p>
                        <p>If we make it an universal rule, we may put an Emphasis upon the word <hi>[received]</hi> q. d. though the Spirit of Bondage sometimes surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth you, yet you do not receive it, you do not give way to it, you do not yield to such fears, but withstand them: you have another Spirit, <hi>(viz.</hi> that of Adoption in you) resisting the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Bondage, and you incline more to that, you prefer that.</p>
                        <p>And further, by the word <hi>(fear)</hi> you may understand <hi>(despair)</hi> such as was in the Gaoler when he would have killed himself, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.</p>
                        <p>But I suppose, 'tis no universal rule, but limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to some of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the stronger sort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, who had obtained the witnesse of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:30732:187"/> the Spirit, <hi>v.</hi> 16. but others of them were weak in Faith, <hi>Ro.</hi> 14. 1.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Some Converts have had great joy and comfort at the time of their first Conversion, As <hi>Zacheus,</hi> Lu. 19. 5, 6, 8, 9. The Eunuch, <hi>Act</hi> 8. 39. <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Friends, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 46. Many of the Gentiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48. The Thessalolians, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 6. Here he speaks of their entrance into the state of Christianity, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. and Chapter 2. 1.</p>
                        <p>This was (probably) the case of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and the eleven Disciples, <hi>John</hi> Baptists hearers, the Seventy, Christs Parents, <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary; Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and his two Sisters, the good Centurion: and possibly the Case of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi> the case of <hi>Noah, Abel, Obadiah,</hi> of whose terror in Conversion we read nothing.</p>
                        <p>'Tis likely these, and many more had either a small degree of fear, or else were possest with Joy at their first Conversion, as <hi>John</hi> Baptist, in his Mothers womb, was.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Ordinarily Satan hath a greater hand in the astonishments and amazements of the Soul, than God. The immoderacy of fear is sin, and Christ reproves it as sin, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 40. <hi>[why are you so fearfull?]</hi> Grace hates and works out this fear, and tis therefore sinfull, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4 18.</p>
                        <p>Who will think that it was Gods motion to the Gaolor▪ to have killed himself in a fit of trembling, <hi>(Act.</hi> 16. 27.) when God hath forbidden Murder in his Law? or is it Gods motion in any troubled Spirit to despair of mercy, and to think of making it self away desperately? An ordinarie temptation, but not of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 13.

                        <p n="4">4. The promises are not made to terrors, but to Faith; yea to Faith, though sometimes mixed (through infirmity) with terrors. Yet not to terrors, but to Faith; not to astonishment, but to Repentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 31. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19. not to despair, but to hope, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 11.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, there are sweet and precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses belonging to many a Soul under terrors; but not for the Terrors sake, not for the Favour that God bears to such terrors; but a means to rid the Soul of such Monsters. The promise belongs properly to the invisible spark of Grace which lies hid under all the ashes and smoak. Such Souls should have no part in the promise, were it not for somewhat in them besides these Terrors. Not the Gaolers terror, nor his degree of terror above ordinary men, could save him; but it was his Faith that saved him.</p>
                        <p>Then, if Christians have Faith and Hope, and Love, and Godly sorrow, and true Repentance, and other Graces, let them never trouble and perplex themselves for want of immoderate fears and terrors. Thus of the fourth Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>

                           <hi>Whether should Repentance be frequently iterated, or only once performed.</hi>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I will distinguish of Repentance. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is either at first Conversion, or after Conversion.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. At Conversion, when a man repents of an evil course of life; of his natural corrupt estate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his change; as the Prodigal Son, the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:30732:189"/>
                           <hi>Manasseth, Paul</hi> and others.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. After Conversion, when a man repents of a particular fact only, as Murder, Adultery, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, Swearing, Apostacy; or other either greater or lesser Sin. As <hi>David</hi> after Conversion repents of that wicked fact in the matter of <hi>Ʋriah,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Peter</hi> of that wicked fact of Cursing, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and denying his Master, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>2. I affirm, that true Repentance to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a continual and daily Repentance: A man should continually repent of his former natural Estate, of his old sins, and much more of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed sins, and particular facts after Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                        <p>I grant there is a Temporarie Repentance as well as a Temporarie Faith; but this is rather to death than life. As <hi>Pharoahs, Ahabs,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> his Repentance and wicked men on sick-beds, and death-beds, they repent by fits and moments.</p>
                        <p>But there is also a continual Repentance, like that of <hi>Davids,</hi> Psalm 51. 3. <hi>[my Sin is ever before me,]</hi> and that of <hi>Paul,</hi> who was alwaies confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and bewailing his former Estate upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 9. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21. Yea thus upright <hi>Job</hi> repents of the sins of his youth, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 26. <hi>[Thou makest me to possess the Iniquities of my youth,]</hi> and thats an eminent Text for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Repentance, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 62, 63. <hi>[I will esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish my Covenant with thee, &amp;c. that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame when I am paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied towards thee, for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God]</hi> compare it with <hi>Ezech.</hi> 20. 43. &amp; chap. 36. 31.</p>

                        <p> Yea <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> continually repented and humbled themselves for the original corruption of their very natures, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 5. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</p>
                        <p>And that the People of God should actually repent of particular sins committed after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, appears (besides the Examples of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter)</hi> from these Scriptures, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 1, 2, &amp;c. 1 <hi>John</hi> 18. 9. <hi>James</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 3 4. and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more places, which speak of the sins of Gods people in a state of Adoption and Justification; and their confession of, and humiliation for them; and these sins might be much aggravated above their sins before Conversion, but that is not my work at present.</p>

                           <hi>Ans.</hi> A man receives the pardon of sin at the time of his actual Repentance, and then is his sin actually pardoned, not from Eternity.</p>
                        <p>I confesse, not only the <hi>Antimonian,</hi> but <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Twisse vind. Gra. pag.</hi> 18.</note> some very Learned and good men, do hold remission of sins to be an immanent action in God, the same with Gods essence, abiding in God, and working no real effect without, upon man.</p>
                        <p>But <note n="*" place="margin">Ames. Anth. Burgesse.</note> others (more agreeable with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) do teach, that Remission of sin is a Transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent action, done in time, and worketh a real change in the subject recipient, <hi>viz.</hi> the Penitent sinner.</p>
                        <p>And though this change which actual pardon works in a man be no inward Physical change; for that pertains to sanctification, yet it is a moral and relative change, as when one is made an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Wife, or Friend, &amp;c.</p>
                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:30732:190"/>
                        <p> The Question is, whether God doth justifie us, or forgive our sins, before we believe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? And my Answer is Negative, that God doth not.</p>
                        <p>Grounds.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Forgivenesse of sin is promised in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as a thing to come, not as a thing past: for why should God promise to do that which he hath done already? <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>[I will forgive their iniquity, &amp;c.]</hi> 'tis not said, I have forgiven, but I will. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The promise of God limits Pardon and Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to the qualified person; not that any are able to qualifie themselves; but he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Pardon, promiseth the Qualification also; and limits his pardon to those whom he shall please to qualifie and fit for it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. <hi>[If we confesse our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins] Mat.</hi> 6. 14, 15. <hi>[If ye forgive not, neither will my heavenly Father forgive you.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Papists</hi> infer from such places a Causality or merit in these Qualifications, which we utterly deny, referring all merit to Christs full satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to Faith, only an Instrumental Causality, not a Meritorious. And though these places do not infer any merit in our Qualifications; yet they do argue a necessary presence of them in those that obtain pardon.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Scripture allows a man to aim at the obtaining of Pardon in the very act of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; though a man is not to merit his Pardon by it, yet he is to acknowledge Repentance the way to Pardon; and 'tis lawfull and necessary for a man to design his pardon (next to the glory
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:30732:191"/> of God) in repenting, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. <hi>[repent, that your sins may be blotted out] Acts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>[that they may receive forgivenesse of sins, &amp;c.]</hi> So <hi>Isaiah</hi> 55. 7. <hi>[turn to our God, for he will pardon.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now 'tis in vain for a man to aim at that which is past, before he was born, or before the world began.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Justification is by Faith, and therefore not without Repentance. Indeed Repentance is not a justifying Grace, but Faith only; yet if actual Justification be not without Faith, it cannot be without Repentance neither: for Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are inseparable in the Subject, and are together in the Soul; a man Repents and Believes at once; though there may be a priority of Nature in these Graces, yet there is none of Time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>[justified by Faith, &amp;c.]</hi>

                        <p>Now (as I said) Repentance and Faith are so together in the Soul, that no impenitent Person can be a Believer; nor can a believing Person, be an Impenitent at the same time that he believes, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 15. <hi>[Repent and Believe.]</hi> mark how they are twined and twisted together, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 32. <hi>[ye Repented not afterward that ye might Believe] Acts</hi> 20. 21.</p>

                        <p>Indeed God did purpose Christ should dye for the Elect from Eternity, and he did purpose to justifie his Elect from Eternity, and he did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to create a World from Eternity; Yet Christ dyed in due time, and the world was made in due time, and the Penitent sinner is justified in due time, not from Eternity.</p>

                        <p>Obj. <hi>But why are not Creation, and Justification, and other things from Eternity, seeing Gods will to Create, and Justifie is from Eternity?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> I answer, Because God is a free Agent, and so his will is not a necessary cause of things; for then they would be immediately, so soon as he willed them, as the Sun-beams are necessarily as soon as the Sun is. But Gods will is a voluntary cause or Principle of things, and so maketh the effect to be at the time he prescribeth. As if there <note place="margin">Simile.</note> were an Artificer or Carpenter that could by his meer will cause an House to be built, He might will this to be done in such and such a year, long after his will of it to be: So God, when the world is made, when a sinner is justified, willed these things from all Eternity, and when they come to have a Being, these effects of his will cause an outward Denomination to be attributed to God, which was not attributed to him before. As now he is Creator, and was not before, now he is a Justifier, and not before. Yet there is no change made in God, but in the Creature only. God doth <hi>velle mutationem,</hi> but not <hi>mut are volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem:</hi> will a change, but not change his will, but by the same unchangeable will, he wills several changes in the same object. 'Tis a great mistake to confound Gods decrees, and the execution of them; his Immanent and Transient Actions, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Though God did will the Glorification of the bodies of all his Saints before the world was, yet it shall not be effected till the end of the world, in the Resurrection. 'Tis ridiculous to say they are glorified before the world was. And you may as truly say, a man believes, and repents before
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:30732:192"/> the world was, as say he is actually justified before the world was, for both were equally decreed of God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
                        <p>Obj. <hi>But Christ gave a full satisfaction to God for the sins of the Elect, and God accepted of it; so that Christ is said to have taken away our sins, and we to be cleansed by his Blood: therefore we are justified before we actually repent or believe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> I answer, Though Christ did lay down a full price, and the Father accept of it, yet both agreed upon a way, and order, and time, when this benefit should be applied, and become actually theirs, for whom it was intended; and that is, when they believe and repent, as is before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. God did accept of Christs death, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <note n="*" place="margin">Burgess <hi>of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation God was truly reconciled so far as to purpose &amp; promise actual pardon.</hi>
                           </note> not only reconcileable, but reconciled; yet this reconciliation to be applied in that way and order which he had decreed and appointed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. God is satisfied, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and engaged to give pardon, but yet he gives it in the way and method which he hath appointed, which is, to give it to a Believer when he believes, and this Faith God will certainly &amp; infallibly work in due time, that so there may be an Instrument in man to receive this pardon.</p>
                        <p>2. Christs death is not a natural Cause of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but a moral and meritorious Cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Natural Causes do necessarily produce their effects, but moral Causes work according to the agreement and libertie of the Persons that are moved thereby. As for example, God the Father, is moved through the death of Christ to pardon the sins of such Persons for whom he dyeth; and resolves absolutely to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:30732:193"/> them: This Agreement is to be made good in that time which they shall pitch upon in their Transaction: Now it pleased the Father that the benefits and fruits of Christs death should be applyed unto the Believer, and not till he doth believe, though this Faith also be at the same time a Gift of God through Christ.</p>
                        <p>We conclude then, that Christ did not satisfie upon condition, nor God accept, upon condition the sinner would believe by his own power; But Christ did really and absolutely satisfie; and God did really and absolutely accept; yet both God and Christ agreed upon a way and time for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this satisfaction, &amp; for actual pardon, and this way is Faith; and this time, the time when Gods Elect do actually repent and believe; and God and Christ agreed also to work these Graces and Qualifications in them in due time.</p>
                        <p>Ob. <hi>But how should Christ accept of Gods promise to pardon, when he had actually satisfied? Actual satisfaction seems to require actual pardon?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> Why may not Christ accept of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers purpose and promise to pardon, as well as the Father accept of Christs purpose and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to satisfie? The first Transaction betwixt God the Father, and God the Son our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, was before the world began; and then both Parties agreed to content themselves with each others purposes and promises till the time of execution and performance; and this was the first Agreement, That the Father should accept of the Sons purpose to die before he dyed, and this purpose be meritorious for all that should believe, from the beginning of the world till
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:30732:193"/> Christs actual incarnation and death: and by vertue of this purpose to dye was <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Prophets saved, who saw Christs day and rejoyced: And on the other hand it was agreed, That God the Son should accept of the Fathers purpose and promise to pardon, from the time of Christs death and satisfaction, till the time of every Believers actual Faith and Repentance, and so to the end of the world. So that on both sides there is equal reason and consideration: an acceptation of mutual promises, till the time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on for performance.</p>
                        <p>And this first Agreement appears not only by the event and order of execution, which falls out accordingly, but also from those Scriptures which mention Gods promise before the world began, and also Christs purpose to dye before the world began; and the Fathers Ordination that this purpose should not be executed till the fulness of time, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>[In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lye promised before the world began.]</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 20: <hi>[Who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, who by him do believe in God, &amp;c.]</hi> Gal. 4. 4. <hi>[But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, &amp;c.]</hi> Fulness of the time, that is, the time agreed upon from eternity, in the first Transaction before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 7. &amp; <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 7.

                        <p>Instruction. This may teach us two Duties.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To value and esteem the doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pentance as a Fundamental of Christianity Some talk as if it were a legal Doctrine, not be comming a Gospel-Preacher; if this were so Christ himself and all his Apostles knew not how to preach Gospel, for they began with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Repentance; and I have proved it to be a Fundamental principle, and necessarie to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Therefore let us learn to prize it, and to see some reason for it that Ministers should frequently urge it, and teach it in the Church; for Fundamentals must be often taught, as I have shewed. O value this doctrine of Repentance as one of the greatest privileges of a Christian, and as one of the richest Gospel-blessings. The Covenant of Works never offered Repentance, or Mercy upon Repentance; but that Covenant ran thus, If you sin you shall die, whether you repent or not; but this is a benefit of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, that Sinners may return and live, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>[God having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to blesse you, in turning away every one of you from his Iniquities.]</hi> O prize Repentance as a Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-blessing. Thus of the first Duty.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Let us practise and obey the doctrine of Repentance; <hi>[Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him turn to the Lord, &amp;c.]</hi> Act. 3. 19. Why, consider (Men and Brethren) God gives you time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 21. and now Mercy may be had, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:30732:194"/> and now God is near to you in the way and means of Grace, <hi>Isay</hi> 55. 6, 7. Now your Peace-maker calls upon you, <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 17. Now you have good motions from Heaven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. Now Gods Embassadors beseech you, yea God himself begs an actual reconciliation, by his Messengers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19, 20.

                        <p>O therefore, I beseech you by the mercies of God, and by the price of your precious Souls, which are more worth than a World, and are the price of blood; I beseech you (by whatever is dear to you) let my Counsell be accepted, and break off your sins by Repentance; Search and try your waies; make humble confession to God, beg for mercy, purpose a new and holy life, endeavour to perform this holy purpose; Strive to enter in at the straight Gate; Let the Kingdom of Heaven suffer violence, and let every man presse into it: O endeavour for Grace: Pray for it; mourn for it, as <hi>Ephraim:</hi> Read for it: Hear for it: Come to Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances for it: use the means, and God hath promised his blessing.

                        <p>This Description hath four Branches.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Faith is an accepting or receiving of Christ; to apply him to our selves as our Own, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, <hi>Io.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>[As many as received him, &amp;c.]</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. <hi>[Worthy of all Acceptation.]</hi> This is called, An embracing the Promise, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. An Impartial accepting: when a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts him as he is offered in the Promise, and upon his own blessed Terms: Not, to accept of Christ in some part of his Office, but in the whole, or all parts of his Office. Faith is not partial in accepting Christ, will not divide him into parts, so as to choose one part of him, and refuse the other. Faith will have him a King, as soon as a Priest and Prophet, <hi>Isay</hi> 33. 22. <hi>[Our</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. This Acceptance is founded upon Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conviction: for how can he heartily accept of Christ, that knows him not, nor sees any need of him, any excellency in him? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>[And we have known and believed.] Ro.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>[How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. This Accepting is founded also in Recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bency or trusting on him, as being all-sufficient, and able to save to the uttermost. For many that are convinced never believe; and so never accept of Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>[As many as received him, &amp;c. even them that believe on his name]</hi> Mat. 12. 21. <hi>[And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.]</hi>

                        <p>This Trust is called, A Staying on God, <hi>Isay</hi> 50. 10. chap. 26. 3.

Perswasion is the Ground of Embracing.</p>
                        <p>We may see this Recumbency in <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 56. 3. in <hi>Iob,</hi> chapt. 13. 15. in <hi>Peter, Ioh.</hi> 6. 68, 69.</p>

                        <p>Thus, there are in Faith three Things, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Spiritual conviction. 2. Holy recumbency, or Trusting. And 3. Impartial acceptation.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Not as a Principal efficient cause: Faith is not a First-worker or Contriver of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but God himself, <hi>Ro.</hi> 3. 30. <hi>[It is one God who shall justifie.]</hi> 'Tis God that plotteth and contriveth Justification, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>[That God would justifie.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Not as a Moving impellent cause: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moved God hereto but his own free Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>[Freely by Grace.] Tit.</hi> 3. 7.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Not as a Meritorious deserving Cause: for Christ only meriteth at the hand of God for us. Thus he only is made our righteousness, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 38, 39.</p>
                        <p>And as we must not over-value Faith in the matter of Justification, so neither must we under-value it: As we must not set it up to too high, so we must not cast it down too low: and therefore in my Negative answer, I adde</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Not as a bare sign or declaration of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as the <hi>Antinomian</hi> would have it: for then, any other Grace (yea and works also) would as much justifie a man as his Faith.</p>
                        <p>Take any other Grace, repentance, humility, love, joy, meekness, temperance, &amp;c. and these all are the fruit of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. and so
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:30732:197"/> they are signs of Elections and Justification.

                        <p>This were to rob Faith of its preheminency above works and other Graces in the matter of Justification.</p>
                        <p>2. How Faith doth justifie, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Relatively. As it referreth and pointeth directly to the righteousness of Christ, for its Object; excluding all hope in Self-righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 30, 31, 32, 33. chapt. 10. 3, 4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22, 25.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Instrumentally. As it is an hand or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to apprehend and apply this righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ offered in the Promise. Hence we are said by Faith to receive the Promise, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. to be joyned to the Lord, and to be one with him, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 50. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Actually. As a Grace in Action, not only in Habit and disposition. 'Tis not the having of a hand, but the stretching of it out, and the using of an hand, whereby a man receives a Gift. 'Tis properly the Act of <hi>Faith</hi> (rather than the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit) that justifies. Indeed God gives this hand of Faith, and God quickens it also, and helps a man to stretch it out; and God also presents the Object, offers Christ to the Soul; all is from God. Yet a man is justified in the very Act of Believing; and so Faith justifies, not as an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment un-used, and lying by; not as an idle folded hand: but as an Instrument brought home to the Object, and as an hand acted and put forth out
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:30732:197"/> of the bosom of the Soul, as an hand embracing the object; embracing, receiving the promise, and Christ in the promise. 'Twas not <hi>Abrahams</hi> power to believe, nor his supernatural disposition to believe, but his actual believing that Justified him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. <hi>[he believed in the Lord, &amp;c.]</hi> and this is the reason why I have described Faith by its saving act of receiving, accepting, trusting, &amp;c. rather than by its habit of power and internal ability. Hence Justification is frequently attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the act of Faith, Act. 13. 39. <hi>[all that believe are justified]</hi> Rom. 3. 26. <hi>[the justifier of him which believeth in Iesus]</hi> Rom. 4. 5. <hi>[that worketh not, but believeth, &amp;c.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet we must not separate the Act from the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, <note place="margin">The Act of Faith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth the Habit.</note> for there can be no saving act of Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an habit at the root thereof. Therefore some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are both set down together when men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of Justification, Rom. 3. 22. <hi>[The righteousnesse of God is by Faith, unto all and upon all them that believe.]</hi> Ephes. 1. 19. <hi>[power to us-ward who believe, according to the working, &amp;c.]</hi> Phil. 1. 29. <hi>[to you it is given to believe on him.]</hi> that is, an inward Habit and Power of Faith is given to you, that you may actually believe.</p>
                        <p>We conclude then, That a man cannot actually believe without an habit of Faith; yet a man is not actually Justified by the habit, but by the act <note place="margin">Christ is applyed by the Act of Faith.</note> of Faith; the Application of Christ is effected by the act of Faith, which is therefore called, the putting on of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. the eating and drinking of Christ, <hi>John</hi> 6. 53, 54. the receiving of Christ, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. a coming to Christ, <hi>John</hi> 6. 37. embracing the promise, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. adhering
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:30732:198"/> or cleaving to Christ, believing, trusting, staying our selves upon him, &amp;c. All which denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons imply action. And indeed it is the first act of <note place="margin">The first Act of Faith justifies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applyeth Christ. Yet is, it not an Action of Merit, but an Action of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental Action.</note> Faith that Justifies. For so soon as ever the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ is applyed, it is imputed; and so soon as ever a man receives a Gift, 'tis his own; and the first act of Faith doth as truly apply Christ, as a thousand several acts can. Hence we are said to have life, as soon as we believe, <hi>John</hi> 3: 36. The case of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Publican, the Issue-woman, the Thief upon the Crosse. Hence a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is Justified by Faith, before his Faith hath produced works, before he hath done any thing but the bare act of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5, 11. 'Tis true, a lively Faith will work by love, yet Justification is not suspended till the works of Faith appear. <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified long before his works (in offering his Son, &amp;c.) appeared, yea before he had a Son to offer, before <hi>Isaac</hi> was born, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. Hence the Scripture is so exact in this point, as to note the time present, for the time of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>[is on all them that believe]</hi> is, 'tis not said only, shall be, but is at present, Rom. 5. 1. <hi>[being Justified, &amp;c.]</hi> Acts 13. 39. <hi>[all that believe are Justified.]</hi> Thus of the second Question.</p>

                           <hi>Whether doth any other Grace Justifie?</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> No other Grace doth Justifie, neither Hope nor Love, nor any other Grace doth Justifie.</p>
                        <p>Grounds.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Scripture gives Faith a preheminence in the matter of Justification, and ascribes it to Faith only, and to no other Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>[a Propitiation through Faith in his blood.]</hi>
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           <pb n="241" facs="tcp:30732:198"/>
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. 'Tis not through Love of his Blood, but through Faith in it. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 1. <hi>[being Justified by Faith, &amp;c.]</hi> and many other places, by Faith, by Faith, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. No other Grace is such an hand to the Soul as Faith is. Let us compare Faith, Hope, and Love, and see which is fittest for this purpose.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Hope is not an hand but an eye to the soul, that wishly looketh for things at a distance, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for things to come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23, 24, 25.</p>
                        <p>And further, Hope is founded in Faith; for he that believes not the promise of God in Christ, cannot hope for the things promised. Hence <hi>Moses</hi> is said by Faith to have respect to the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, to have respect to the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25. And hence Faith is said to be the substance of things hoped for, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Love is an hand as well as Faith, yet not such an hand as Faith is, not a receiving hand, but a giving hand, that gives out, communicates, and distributes. Love is kind, seeketh not her own, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 35.</p>
                        <p>Again, Love is founded in Faith. The Ground of our Love to Christ is our Faith in him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 19. <hi>[we loved him because he first loved us]</hi> that is, because we believe he loved us, as is before expressed, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>[We have known and believed the Love that God hath to us.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Faith is a receiving hand, and so fittest to apply and embrace Christ, and the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ unto Justification. Faith is an hand that is stretched out and opens it self to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this gift of God, so doth not Love, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7. <hi>[received Christ Jesus</hi>

                           <hi>the Lord]</hi> speaking before and after of Faith.</p>
                        <p>Obj. <hi>But true Faith is never alone, is alwaies joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Hope, and Love, and other Graces: for there is a Con-catenation of Graces, all are fruits of one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Gal. 5. 22, 23. <hi>Therefore other Graces justifie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> I answer, Though Faith be never alone in the Person Justified, yet it is alone in the Act and office of Justification. Though <hi>Abraham</hi> had all these Graces in him, yet Faith only is reckoned to him for Righteousnesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5, 9.</p>
                        <p>The eye in the body is not alone, for there are more Members joyned with it, yet the eye in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is alone, for no part of the body seeth but the eye.</p>
                        <p>The hand in the body is not alone, but joyned with other Members, yet no part of the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth gifts, but the hand.</p>
                        <p>So Faith, it is not alone in the soul, hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces joyned with it, yet no other Grace Justifies but Faith, because no other Grace appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends and applyes Christs Righteousnesse but Faith: for (as I said) Faith is a receiving hand, a begging hand, an accepting hand, is all for its self, would have Christ for its self, Pardon and Grace for its self, Heaven and Salvation for its self; grasps and gathers to its self, all the riches and fulnesse of Christ, and brings all home to its self, into its own bosom.</p>
                        <p>And if no other Grace Justifies, then much less can works Justifie. And that place of the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 24. must be construed as meant of the Justifying of a particular fact, not of Justifying a Person, for <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Justified Person before he offered up his Son, yet he was not Justified and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:30732:199"/> Approved in that particular fact till he had done it, compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 10, 11, 12. and <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 21, 22. And this was the case of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Also we must distinguish of Justification in the sight of God, and that in the sight of men; in the sight of God, when God reputes a man just for Christs sake, This is by Faith only: in the sight of men, when one man is reputed just of another, This is not by Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by Works, and this St. <hi>Iames</hi> speaks of, Jam. 2. 18. <hi>[I will shew thee my Faith by my Works.]</hi>

                        <p>Obj. <hi>But Love is greater than Faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. <hi>Sol.</hi> Not in the point of Justification, but in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respects, Love is the greater Grace, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. In respect of the manner of working. Faith works by receiving, Love by giving, and 'tis a greater honour to give than to receive, compare <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 2, 3. with <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 35.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In respect of the object. The object of Faith is God only in Christ: But the object of Love is, both God and Man. Herein Love exceeds Faith, even in the extent of its object; we may love any thing that is good, but we must trust in nothing but God. We may love our Neighbour, but not believe in him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 5, 7.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In respect of manifestation of grace. Faith is proved and made manifest by Love. Faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work without Love, but worketh by Love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. and the works of Love manifest and prove Faith, both to thy self and others, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4.

Hence Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaking of works of love and mercy a little before, <hi>v.</hi> 15. addeth, <hi>[By works was Faith made perfect, v.</hi> 22.] that is, as Gods strength is made perfect in weakness, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. The meaning is, my strength is declared and manifested to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the weakness of man; So the strength (and comparative perfection) of faith is shewed in love.

But some men have a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary faith, and receive with joy the word, and approve of it, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13. Again, the one is for a time, the other lasting.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>5. The difference betwixt Justifying faith, and the faith of Assurance. They differ,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In Nature. The Nature of Justifying faith is Adherence, or cleaving to Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23. <hi>Job</hi> 13. 15. But the Nature of Assurance, is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Demonstration, <hi>Heb:</hi> 11. 1. <hi>[The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not seen.]</hi> 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 1. 12. <hi>[I know whom I have believed.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. In the object. The object of Justifying faith
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:30732:201"/> is Christ offered, Christ in the promise, Christ without us, not yet applied, <hi>John</hi> 7. 37, 38. But the object of Assuring-faith, is Christ within us, Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith, Christ already applyed; not the imputed righteousness of Christ, but the inherent righteousness, or Grace in the Soul; whether knowledge, or faith, or love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 John 2. 3. <hi>[we know that we know him:]</hi> 1 John 3. 14. <hi>[we know that we have possed from death to life because we love, &amp;c.]</hi> and vers: 24. <hi>[we know that he abideth in us.]</hi> chap. 4. 13. <hi>[we know that we dwell in him, and he in us.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. In Act. The Act of Justifying faith is direct, leads directly to Christ. Hence tis called <hi>a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ,</hi> John 6. 37. But the Act of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is reflect; leading us into our own hearts, to see, what Christ hath done for us there, and what he hath enabled us to doe, 1 John 5. 20. 2 Pet: 1. 10. <hi>[your calling sure.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. In Ends and Aims. Justifying faith aims at Salvation by Christ, <hi>Heb:</hi> 10. 39. 1 Pet. 1. 9. But Assurance aims at Consolation and present joy, Gal: 6. 4. <hi>[Then shall he have rejoycing in himself, &amp;c.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. In Use. The use of Justifying faith is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; to apply Christ; called, Eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. called, A receiving, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, &amp;c. But the use of Assurance is, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and strengthning of our first faith; to enable us to apply him with more boldness and resolution, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>[These things have I written to you that believe, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe, &amp;c.]</hi> q. d. Assurance of eternal life will make Believers to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:30732:202"/> believe more, more strongly, more resolutely; and to persevere in believing, to believe more victoriously, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37, 38.</p>
                        <p>6. In Time. One is before the other; Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith is before Assurance; may be without Assurance, but Assurance cannot be without it <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13, 14. <hi>[After ye believed, ye were sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again, Justifying faith is before Obedience and good works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. But Assurance is after Obedience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4. compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17, 18. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15, 16. Thus of the difference.</p>
                        <p>The faith of Miracles hath been, and is not, is now ceased; therefore I have not mentioned it. Yet you may note what the difference was, <hi>viz</hi> want of love and sincerity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2.</p>
                        <p>Some speak also of an Hypocritical faith. But to distinguish Justifying faith from all other that can be named, It hath these Properties.</p>

                           <p>Though godly fear be not despair, yet 'tis very like it, in several respects.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Godly fear is a fear of Hell and of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>[Let us fear lest we come short]</hi> that is, of Heaven, and what is this but to be afraid of dropping into Hell?</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It makes a man afraid of God, and of his

                           <p n="3">3. It begets much trembling, astonishment and terrour in the Soul, to keep it from sin and presuming. <hi>Job</hi> reckons it up among his graces, <hi>Iob</hi> 31. 23. <hi>[destruction from the Almighty was a terrour to me]</hi> and we find it in <hi>Paul</hi> when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to turn to God and be a new man, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 6.</p>

                           <p>Though Godly fear differs from despair, yet
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:30732:205"/>
'tis many times accompanied with despair in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hearts. As appears in the case of <hi>Job, David, Heman,</hi> and others before named.</p>
                           <p>Hence it is that God commands to fear, and yet not to fear, Isaiah 35. 4. <hi>[say to them that are of a fearfull heart, fear not]</hi> that is, not so much; not to despair; moderate your fear according to that Question in the Gospel, Why are ye so fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? out of measure fearfull? &amp;c. and Isaiah 50. 10. <hi>[who is among you that feareth the Lord, that walketh in darknesse, and hath no light?]</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Yet despair doth not reign in a Believer; but he resists it, prayes against it, and checks himself for it; and though sometimes it may get the upper hand, yet not alway; not commonly and constantly; but ordinarily he puts a check to it, as <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 42. 5. <hi>[Why art thou cast down, O my soul; and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God, &amp;c.] q. d.</hi> do not despair of his mercy.</p>

Yet (being in dreadfull horrour and in the very mouth of Hell) 'tis like he wished another had done the Fact, and not himself; and so probably the Devils themselves repent, that they fell into Hell; and may wish that the holy Angels had fallen, and not they; yet their malice is not thereby lessened.</p>

                              <hi>But I doubt I have no Faith: For I do all out of a slavish fear; and if I love or serve God 'tis for my own ends. But faith worketh by love; and we should love God for himself,</hi> Psal. 73. 25.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Possibly that fear, which you call a slavish fear, is a Filial fear: for I have shewed you that Godly fear is (in some sense) a fear of Hell and punishment. May not a true Child love his Father, and yet be afraid of his rod, and of his anger, &amp;c?</p>
                           <p>2. I have before proved, That Faith and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing fear may be together in a true Believer: and what is Despair but a slavish fear? that God will destroy us?</p>
                           <p>3. Suppose you were out of all fear of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:30732:208"/> would not the hope of Heaven, and of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying God for ever in holiness and happiness, draw you from sin to duty, if there were no Hell? Do not belve your own heart, but answer the Question. What but love to God can make you desire him for ever? are you not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken about your motives to obedience? Is there no love with your fear?</p>
                           <p>4. What are Gods threatnings for, but to make us afraid? and what are his promises for, but to make us (for love to our selves) to obey, and to design our own salvation? Yea God hath put into our very nature several passions, of hope, fear, love, &amp;c. and promiseth to sanctifie them, not to root them out of our natures: for Grace doth not destroy Nature, but restore it to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Do not you think to separate what God hath joyned together; but be content to have fear in you whiles you live, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>[pass the time of your sojourning here in fear,]</hi> Proverbs 28. 14.</p>
                           <p>5. If your own ends be not sin, but Salvation, and Pardon, and Heaven, &amp;c. 'tis fit you should serve God for your own ends; for such ends as these. For</p>
                           <p n="1">1. God proposeth such ends as these to you as Motives to Obedience; and be sure God would not have you to do evil that good may come on it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 26.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. God commands us to aim at such ends as these, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>[Work out your own Salvation.]</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5 8. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 24.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The best Christians that are, do (in this sense) serve God for their own ends. <hi>Moses</hi> had

                           <p n="4">4. We should utterly renounce the Grace of Hope, if we deny a I aiming at our selves, for what is hope but an expectation of good to come? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24, 25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. <hi>Abraham</hi> believed in hope as well as in love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
                           <p>Though we should serve God out of love, and love him for himself, yet not out of love only, but out of fear also; and not only for himself, but for our selves also: For these two cannot be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, Gods glory, and Mans good. <hi>Josephs</hi> Argument was, <hi>For I fear God; Jobs</hi> Motive was, <hi>For destruction from the Almighty was a terror to me,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. <hi>[Lest I my self should be a Cast-away.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>7. Though some of Gods Saints have loved him more for himself, than for their own ends, yet I know Weaklings in Faith, and Babes in Christ do not alway so, but ordinarily, Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Christianity do aim more at themselves than at God, and more at mercy than holyness. As appears by that ordinary Question of New-born Babes, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30. <hi>[What must I do to be saved?]</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And indeed this is the proper design of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, to aim at Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 39. <hi>[We are of them that believe, to the saving of the Soul.]</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>[the end of your Faith, even the Salvation of your Souls.]</hi> Yea the true Believer is described by this property of seeking eternal life, and aiming thereat, in his doing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>[to them who seek for glory, &amp;c.]</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I have before shewed, that Faith is all for it
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:30732:209"/> self, and is properly a Receiving hand, alwaies opening for some Gift. Now as the Saints have several Graces, they are not all Faith, nor all Love, nor all Hope, but there is in them a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Faith, and Fear, and Hope, and Love, &amp;c. So the distinct acts of these graees are several: and sometimes, they are more in the exercise of this grace, than of that; sometimes, they fear; anon they hope; and then they believe, and then they love; and again they repent, and sorrow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; and exercise their graces according as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions and objects offer themselves. So they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, ought not to be alwaies in one temper, and one exercise of Soul.</p>

                     <head type="sub">[Of the doctrine of Baptisms.]</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> The doctrine of the baptism of water is a fundamental doctrine; One of the first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Christian Religion. As a sober judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may gather out of these Scriptures, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with my text, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37, 38. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. and especially <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 29, 30. But because I have promised to prove Baptism a Fundamental, I will set down particular grounds for it.</p>
                     <p>Grounds.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because the Master-builders began to build with this doctrine; It is laid in the foundation; Tis one of those Capital doctrines which were first taught, to promote christianity in the world; and thus it was taught by <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> Mark
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:30732:210"/> 1. 4. and by our Lord Jesus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. and by the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37, 38.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Because Baptism is one of the marks of the Church, and defended for such by all Protestant Writers. Hence the Scripture supposeth and takes it for granted, that all visible disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Church members are baptized. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 1. 2, 3. The making and baptising of disciples is coupled together, John 4. 1. <hi>[made and baptised more disciples, &amp;c.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence it is that the Church will admit none to Communion in the Lords Supper unbaptised, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41, 42. What said <hi>David</hi> of the Philistin, <hi>This uncircumcised Philistin,</hi> in indignation? so may we say of any that refuse baptism, <hi>This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptised Jew or Infidel,</hi> as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> saith in effect, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 30. <hi>q. d.</hi> these unbaptised reprobates: meaning such as might have been baptised, but would not.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Because it is a Comprehensive doctrine. It comprehends in it the doctrine of Christ, of the Covenant of Grace, of Repentance, of Faith, of Remission of sins, of Sanctification, and of the Resurrection; as I shall have occasion to prove, when I come to the description of Baptism; and those that are acquainted with the Scriptures, know it very well.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Because it is a necessary doctrine; and much urged as a matter of life and death. Yea tis so far necessary to salvation, that the refusal of it damneth; I do not say, the want of baptism damneth, but the wilfull refusal of it when it may be had, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 29; 30. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:30732:210"/>
                     <p> Hence the Primitive Christians at first conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion were so earnest and importunate in Calling for baptism, and the Ministers so hasty to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise them, as the Eunuch calls immediately for baptism, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 36. the Jaylor strait-way, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 33. and <hi>Ananias</hi> puts <hi>Paul</hi> upon it in speed, and great haste, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 16 <hi>[Why tarriest thou? arise and be baptised.]</hi> I shall have occasion to speak more of the necessity of it, afterwards.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Because Christ himself submitted to the doctrine of baptism. He would not die unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, but calls for it of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> most earnestly, as one that would take no Nay; though <hi>Iohn</hi> would fain have excused him, as one that had no need of baptism, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 13, 14, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviours reverend esteem of baptism is exemplarie to us, and teacheth us how to Judge of it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Because the doctrine and administration of Baptism is expresly signed and subscribed to, by the reverend and adored name of the blessed Trinity. God hath put upon it all his Name, as appears in the form of baptism, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>[Baptizing them in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Kings and Princes are ashamed their names <note place="margin">The Name of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not set to every thing, no not to every l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>'Tis true, God is not ashamed of the least
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:30732:211"/> Title of truth in his Law; yet wherein this his whole Name is set down expresly, and purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a particular work or truth, it argues an extraordinary, weighty glorious truth or work.</p>
                     <p>The name of the blessed Trinity is set down expresly in the Scripture to the glorious work of Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. <hi>[Let us make man.]</hi> So again he subscribed to the work of Redemption, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7, 8, 9, 10. 'Tis used in the Action of ministerial and solemn blessing of the Church, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14. So <hi>Paul</hi> begins his Epistles with Grace and Peace from the blessed Trinity. And thus baptism: and these are all weighty works. But the name of the blessed Trinity is seldom used to other things.</p>
                     <p>Hence they that submit to baptism are said to justifie God, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 29. an high expression, not applyed to mean matters, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4. which shews, that the rejection of baptism is a condemning of the blessed Trinity, an accusing God of folly, a reproaching of the wisedom, goodness, name, and the glorious attributes of our Maker.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Because it is commonly ranked and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with Fundamentals in Scripture. How frequently is baptism coupled with Faith, with Repentance, with remission of Sins, with Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2.</p>
                     <p>He that shall thorowly weigh all these grounds, will certainly conclude, that I have rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded my Text, and that baptism of water may justly claim the place and honor of a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principle.</p>

                           <p>Baptism is a Ministerial washing with water, in the name of the blessed Trinity. The external <note n="*" place="margin">I will speak of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of washing afterwards in a Quest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion by it self.</note> matter of baptism is water, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 36. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47.

                           <p>'Tis not washing by Midwives or Lay-men, or by every man, that is baptism, but that which is done by Gods Messenger, or by some man of God; nor every washing of a Minister, but a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn washing in the name of God, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, of which I have spoken in the beginning. Baptism without this form, is no baptism, but a changing and perverting of Gods Ordinance, an offering of strange fire with <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> and no better than the cutting off a Dogs neck for a Sacrifice to God, as that expression is, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 66. 3.</p>
                           <p>'Tis the action of the Minister in Gods stead, and Gods name, and by Gods own appointment, that gives form, and essence, and being to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, as also to any other publike Church-Ordinance.</p>

                           <p>The effect of baptism is different, according to its different subjects. 'Tis a sign only to some, a seal to others, a conveying Instrument to others, to convey Grace into their hearts.</p>

                           <p>'Tis the holy Spirit that seals the Covenant of Grace to a believer, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13. now where the Spirit is not, there is no Interest in Christ, and consequently no seal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>John</hi> 14. 16, 17.</p>

'Tis a sign and seal both to them; as Circumcision was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. 11. now Baptism is greater than Circumcision, and therefore a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Seal to the Faithfull, as Christ is greater than <hi>Moses,</hi> Mark 16. 16. <hi>[He that believeth and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised shall be saved.]</hi> q. d.

For 1. The Apostles were truly sanctified long before they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised with the Holy Ghost; for the Holy Ghost was not given before Christ was glorified. Compare <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 5. with ch. 2. 4. &amp; ch. 11. 15, 16, 17. 2ly.

                        <p>We conclude then, That the baptism of the Spirit is ceased, but the baptism of Water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, and shall continue in honour among Christians to the end of the world: and further, that the Sanctification of the Spirit shall abide to the end; but that is not the baptism of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the baptism of the Holy Ghost was another thing, far different from Sanctification.</p>

                        <p> Now Protestants tread the narrow path of Truth betwixt these two extremes, in teaching it to be Necessary, very Necessary, generally and ordinarily Necessary: yet not absolutely so in all cases.

                        <p>2. I affirm, that baptism of water is generally and ordinarily necessary to Salvation, and they do erre damnably who say 'tis needlesse.

Is it a needlesse thing to justifie God, and to receive the Counsel of God? <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 29, 30. 6. Would the Apostle have commanded those that had received the Holy Ghost, to submit to a needlesse thing? <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47, 48. 7.

Circumcision and Uncircumcision are all one in Christ: that is, the Jews and Gentiles are all one in him; for the Jews were called in those dayes, the Circumcision; and the Gentiles were called, the Uncircumcision, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
                        <p>Take heed then of wresting dark sayings in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles to thy own Destruction, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 16.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, those that say baptism is needlesse, are Blasphemers: and were they tempted to it, they would not stick to say, That for <hi>Adam</hi> to be forbidden the Apple in Paradise, was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse; and so God to have condemned the whole world, and to have cast Millions of souls into Hell, for not doing a needlesse thing, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause; but woe to him that striveth with his maker; yea I am afraid some of these slighters of baptism, have been bold to say, The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are needlesse, and all Religion needlesse.</p>
                        <p>Well: As needlesse as baptism is, those that call it so, and despise it upon that account, shall be damned for Blasphemers and Reprobates if they repent not, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 30.</p>
                        <p>But (Christians) we have not so learned Christ, let us abhor all such Blasphemous thoughts, as to account any of Gods Ordinances

                        <p>The proof of this point from this place, lieth in the context and scope thereof, which is this.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Apostle warns them of false Teachers, who taught Judaism, and would have joyned Baptism and Circumcision together, and would have baptised Christians to be circumcised, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>[the rudiments of the world,]</hi> that is, the Law of <hi>Moses, Gal.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>

                              </gap>1.</note> I say, the false Teachers might object thus. You Christian Gentiles are not so compleat in Christ as you pretend, for you are not Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised as <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Prophets were (who saw Christs day and rejoyced, and so were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians as compleat as you can be.)</p>
                        <p>The Apostle gives in his answer to this Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. q. d. you Gentiles are Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, though not with external Circumcision, yet with a better Circumcision, the Internal, that of the Heart, and so ye have the chiefest Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
                        <p>Obj. <hi>But they might still object, You ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the external also, as a sign and seal of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Circumcision, as did Abraham our Father, who had both, and so ought ye to have both.</hi> Rom. 4. 11.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> To this also the Apostle replyeth, at the latter end of <hi>v.</hi> 11. with <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>[ye are Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Circumcision of Christ, buried with him in baptism,]</hi> q. d. Though you have not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circumcision of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Law, yet ye have the outward Circumcision of the Gospel and of Christ, and that is baptism: So you have Grace, and the sign of Grace as well as <hi>Abraham</hi> had, you have the Spirit, and the Water, Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Baptism.</p>
                        <p>Now unlesse Baptism had plainly answered to Circumcision, and been placed by Christ in the room thereof, the Apostles answer had been Insufficient, and had not at all availed, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and satisfie the Objectors. 'Tis plain he pleads baptism to throw off and abolish Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:30732:220"/> and calleth baptism circumcision by a Figure, the circumcision of Christ, all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumcision that Christ will allow of.</p>
                        <p>2. Because baptism is appointed for the same use and end under the new Testament, that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was appointed for under the old.</p>
                        <p>Compare baptism and circumcision together, and 'twill appear, that whatever circumcision was for then, baptism is for the same now. The main uses and ends of the one, are the main uses and ends of the other. And this is an Invincible Argument of true succession.</p>

Baptism of water only, is an entrance into the Church-body. Otherwise, since the baptism of Tongues and Miracles was ceased, how should men be baptised into the body? 2ly. All the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were not baptised with the baptism of the Holy Ghost at all, as the Apostle affirms in the same Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30. <hi>[are all workers of Miracles? have all the gifts of Healing? do all speak with tongues?]</hi> and this speaking with tongues was the baptism of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.

True Succession requires not an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Predecessors and Successors in every circumstance, Christ succeded <hi>Moses;</hi> the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Law; the Covenant of Grace, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works; the Lords Supper succeeded the Passeover; and <hi>Solomon</hi> succeeded <hi>David.</hi> Yet all these Successions differed in many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances?</p>
                        <p>Otherwise (if there were no difference) there would be no Successor but the same. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Solomon</hi> would not be <hi>Solomon,</hi> but <hi>David</hi> still; and otherwise Baptism would not be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism but circumcision.</p>
                        <p>2. All the differences betwixt circumcision and baptism are advantagious for Christians. As, that none of our blood is required in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; that baptism is not confined to the eighth day, but may be done before or after; and that Women may be baptised; and that it is not so painfull and sore as circumcision was. These are all a change for the better; and confirm its succession; for therefore a change is made, that
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:30732:221"/> Christians might have a better Sign and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the Jews had: otherwise there needed not a change.</p>
                        <p>Obj. <hi>But baptism was instituted before circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was abolished; therefore succeeded not.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. True, it was instituted while circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision was in use; but it did rather languish than live after baptism. Gods wisedom would not take down the one Ordinance till he had fully setled the other; because the hearts of People were over-wedded to it. <hi>Paul</hi> observed it a while to please the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 3. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he preached and wrote against it, in his Epistles. 2. Baptism is left in possession of all its offices and ends as is before shewed; and therefore baptism truly succeeds.</p>
                        <p>3. Did not <hi>Solomon</hi> succeed <hi>David?</hi> yet he was crowned before <hi>David</hi> was dead, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 1. 48. and did not Christ and the Gospel succeed the Law? yet Christ (the substance) was born, before the law of ceremonies was wholly and actually abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. Old circumcision (like old <hi>David)</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to see the Crown put upon the Head of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and to give baptism possession of the Church, and rejoyced and dyed the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably, having such a Successor?</p>

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:30732:222"/> And indeed without the knowledge of these Rules a man is not able to bear this truth, as our Saviour said in another case, <hi>John</hi> 16, 12.</p>
                        <div n="1" type="rule">
                           <head>
                              <hi>Rule</hi> 1.</head>
                           <p>There are many great Truths plainly couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and comprehended in Scripture, which are not plainly and positively expressed in so many terms and words; and that in the old and new Testament.</p>
                           <p>Our Saviour undertakes by sound reason and consequence to prove (against the Sadduces) the resurrection, and he proves it by a Scripture that had not any express word of the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it. And though the word (resurrection) was not in the Text, yet the Thing was there, and our Saviour cleared it by reasoning, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 31, 32. The proof of the resurrection from this Text, lyeth in the circumstance of time, when God spake thus, <hi>viz.</hi> in the daies of <hi>Moses,</hi> which was many years after <hi>Abraham</hi> was dead, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 6. Now our Saviour infers thus, If God was <hi>Abrahams</hi> God in <hi>Moses</hi> time, then God was his God after he was dead; and then dead <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was alive in Soul, after his body was laid in the Grave, waiting for a joyfull resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and consequently the dead shall rise.</p>
                           <p>Now we have as good proof as this for Infant-baptism, <hi>viz.</hi> Scripture-inference, and good consequence; which is so solid and sufficient proof, that it convinced Christs Hearers of the resurrection, and made the people astonished at his Doctrine, as it follows in the next Verse, 33. <hi>[And when the multitude heard this they were asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at his Doctrin.]</hi> So that the most powerfull
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:30732:222"/> and Soul-convincing Doctrin of Christ was grounded upon Scripture consequence.</p>
                           <p>Again, there is no Text in the Old Testament that saith plainly and syllabically in so many words, That Jesus the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> is the Christ; yet <hi>Paul</hi> (after his Masters example) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to prove this weighty truth by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old Testament, (for then there was no New Testament in force, and received as Scripture) and this he doth by reasoning out of the Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 1, 2, 3. So <hi>Appollos, Acts</hi> 18. 28. And <hi>Peter</hi> reasons out of many say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Moses, David,</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22, 23, 24. Allow but of such reasoning, and we shall easily prove Infant-baptism.</p>
                           <p>I will give some particular instances out of the New Testament, of Truths not expressed fully.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The Deity or Godhead of the Holy Ghost: 'Tis no where said <hi>in terminis,</hi> The Holy Ghost is God; yet 'tis plainly couched and implyed in the Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> Acts 5. 3, 4. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. and 'tis a damnable Heresie to deny it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 31, 32.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Souls immortality. 'Tis no where said the Soul of Man cannot dye, but lives for ever; yet 'tis plainly couched in <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 39. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. and many other places.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Doctrin of the Christian Sabbath. 'Tis no where expresly said, Let the Christian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath be kept upon the first day of the week; yet 'tis couched and implyed in these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>John</hi> 20. 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2. and other places.</p>
                           <p n="4">
                              <pb n="290" facs="tcp:30732:223"/> 4. The right of women to the Lords Supper is no where expressed; yet 'tis implyed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. where the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> signifies, Male and Female. And 'tis a harder task to prove that Women should partake of the Lords Table, than it is to defend Infant-baptism; and so you would say your selves, if you knew all the Objections that might be devised against it. Yet I do believe it for truth, upon the same grounds that I believe Infant-baptism, <hi>viz.</hi> Scripture-inference, and therefore will not start Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against it.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. The Doctrin of a Christian Magistrate Neither Christ nor his Apostles did rule in State-Government; and 'tis no where said, Christians may be Rulers over men; only some good men under the old Testament were Rulers; and 'tis couched in that Text where Magistracy is called an Ordinance of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The translating of the Scriptures into the <hi>English</hi> tongue or any other language. God left it in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek;</hi> and 'tis no where said, Let the Bible be turned into <hi>English;</hi> yet it is couched and implyed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                           <p>All these great Doctrins are not expressed in full words; only deducted and derived from the Scripture by reasoning, and so may be deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, Derivative-Scripture, Scripture-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.</p>
                           <p>Yet whoever shall deny all these truths, haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards his Soul, and is nigh to perdition.</p>
                           <p>They that deny Infant-baptism upon this ground, that it is not plainly exprest in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:30732:223"/> may upon the same account, deny the Holy Ghost as God, the Souls immortality, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian sabbath, the Lords supper to women, and the <hi>English</hi> Bible.</p>
                           <p>Yea this false Principle <hi>(viz.</hi> denyal of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-consequence) justifies the Jews in denying Christ; for it could not be proved out of the Old Testament, That Jesus is the Christ, any other way than by sound consequence, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of one Text with another: and the Jews had a command to receive no doctrin but what was proved by the Old Testament, <hi>Isay</hi> 8. 20.</p>
                           <p>We conclude then, That Scripture-conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is an undoubted truth, as is the very let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and phrase of Scripture; and by Scripture-consequence I mean the collection of truth not fully expressed in one place, out of several scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered words of Scripture rightly compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, according to that rule set down by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 13.</p>

                           <p>Those Truths which are only couched and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in Scripture, are to be equally owned and received, with those that are more fully exprest, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18, 19.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. Of those truths that are equal in weight and importance, some are reveiled more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, others more obscurely. As in the Doctrin of the Trinity, The Father and Son are expresly called God (without any need of arguing;) but the Holy Ghost is not so plainly called God. Hence it is that some Heretiques have deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Godhead of the Holy Ghost; and

                           <p n="1">1. The Doctrine of the Christian Sabbath is greater than the Doctrine of the Jewish Sabbath, yet the Jewish Sabbath is more plainly reveiled <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Doctrine of Womens praying with their heads covered, is lesse than the Doctrine of the Lords Supper, yet that is more plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled than this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 5. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>[this is my body,]</hi> a dark expression.</p>
                           <p n="3">3.

                           <p>Now, If men should embrace plain Doctrines only, and reject the obscure, they should em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the lesser Truths onely, and reject the greater.</p>
                           <p>Therefore let us search the Scriptures, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read them, but search out the sense, <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. and prize the Ministry of the Gospel, which is ordained for the help of Christians in such cases of obscure Revelation, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 30, 31, &amp;c.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:30732:224"/> And let us think never the worse of any Truth, for the obscurity of its Revelation; or because it cannot be proved any other way than by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-consequence, for that is nothing but a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the sense of Scripture, and Scripture-sense is greater than Scripture-expression, as appears in that phrase concerning the Sacrament. This is my body, the sense of these words is greater than the expression.</p>
                           <p>Scripture-sence is the inside, the narrow, and the soul of Scripture; and the Soul is more excellent than the Body, though it be not so visible.</p>

The reason is, because no man Questioned these things in those dayes. Even so though enough be said for Infant-baptism in the Scripture, yet Christ and his Apostles do not insist so much and so exactly upon it, because it was not in Question in the Apostles dayes, <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <pb n="299" facs="tcp:30732:228"/>
                           <p> But Infants of Christians were baptised in the daies of Christ and his Apostles, as appears by those honourable and glorious Titles which Christ and his Apostles have put upon such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, which imply and presuppose their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; Titles which they gave to none but bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised Persons. Infants in those daies were called (and accounted) Disciples, Christians, Saints, the blessed of the Lord, Members of the Church (or the Kingdom) of God: and these all are considerable and weighty Titles. And thus we come to know that the Apostles were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, <hi>viz.</hi> by their Title, they are called Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>1. Disciples. We read of Infant-Disciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. <hi>[why tempt you God to put a Yoke upon the neck of the Disciples, &amp;c.]</hi> This Yoke was Circumcision after the manner of <hi>Moses, v.</hi> 1. <hi>[certain men taught and said, except ye be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,</hi>

                              </gap>
                              <hi>after the manner or custom of</hi> Moses, <hi>ye cannot be saved.]</hi> Now the manner or custom of <hi>Moses</hi> was to circumcise Infants, <hi>Lev.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3. Therefore they were Infant-Disciples, upon whose Neck the Apostles would not suffer this yoke of circumcision to be put in the daies of the Gospel, when Christ had abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished circumcision, and had substituted baptism (an easier yoke) in the room thereof, as I have before proved; and though they taught the brethren (men of understanding) this doctrin, yet they intended the circumcision to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, they taught them what they should do to their Infants, and would have put the yoke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Infants, as in time of old God himself taught
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:30732:229"/> the doctrin of circumcision to <hi>Abraham</hi> an old man, yet he intended the thing taught to his Infant <hi>Isaac,</hi> not to <hi>Abraham</hi> only. And that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were then reckoned for Disciples of Christ appears further by the other Titles which I shall treat of in order.</p>
                           <p>Now (as I formerly noted) the Scripture takes it for granted, that if any one be Christs Disciples, he is baptised, and to call them Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples is to call them baptised persons; for who ever read or heard of an Unbaptised-Disciple? Yea the Adversaries of Infant-baptism do grant and confess that all Disciples should be baptised; and if they should not grant, yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 3. &amp; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>[Jesus made and baptised Disciples.]</hi> We read not of the baptism of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the other eleven Disciples; yet this Title (Disciple) proves their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
                           <p>2ly. Christians. We read of Infant-Christians, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 47, 48. compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 36, 37. <hi>[Whosoever shall receive this child in my name, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth me, &amp;c.]</hi> and again <hi>[Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, &amp;c.]</hi> q. d. I am the Christ, and they are Christians, and I have put my name upon them, and you shall receive them in my name, you shall receive them, even this child, and any such, as Christians. Such a Phrase as that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 41, 42. <hi>[in the name of a Prophet, a righteous man; in the name of a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.]</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now who knows not that only baptised per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were ever called Christians, at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and in all the world.</p>
                           <pb n="301" facs="tcp:30732:229"/>
                           <p> 3ly. Saints, or Holy ones. We read of Infant-Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>[were your children unclean, but now they are holy,]</hi>
                              <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, Saints, or Holy ones, or, holy Children, 'tis the same word that is used in all <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, for Saints and Members of the Church, yea 'tis used so in the same Epistle, chap. 1. 2. <hi>[to the Church of God, to the called Saints,]</hi>

                           <p>Now by Saints the Apostle alwaies means baptised ones, as is plain in the same Epistle, He tells the Saints they were all baptised; compare 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2, 13. with <hi>chap.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>[all baptised in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one body, &amp;c.]</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And that Infants of Believers have been ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in time of old reckoned for Saints, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 148. 12, 13, 14. <hi>[young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the name of the Lord, the praise of all his Saints.]</hi> What was <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> child that died in Infancy, and <hi>John</hi> the baptist, and those Infant-Martyrs which <hi>Herod</hi> slew in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and what were thousands more but Infant-Saints? Observe diligently what <hi>David</hi> speaks for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and his Infant in this case, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 9, 10. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 22, 23. and God loved <hi>Solomon</hi> so soon as he was born, <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25. Yea the very time of the birth of Infants is noted as the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al time of Gods bowels towards them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 4, 5, 6, 8.</p>
                           <p>4ly. The blessed of the Lord. We read of blessed Infants, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>[They brought young children to him, &amp;c. And he took them up into his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them;]</hi> and long before this, children were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:30732:230"/> The blessed of the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 13, 14, 15. <hi>[Small and great, you and your children, you are the blessed of the Lord, &amp;c.]</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And this blessing of the Lord did never belong either to the uncircumcised, or to the unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised; and therefore 'tis limited in that Psalm to the circumcised House of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Aaron, v.</hi> 12.</p>
                           <p>5. Members of the Church or Kingdom of God. We read also of Infant-Church-members, and Infant-Heirs of Gods Kingdom. 'Tis recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by three Evangelists, that Christ declared them to be Members of his Kingdom. Note especially one place, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17.] <hi>They brought unto him Infants also; he said, Forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdom of God, whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, &amp;c.]</hi> q. d. Little children do receive the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Kingdom of Grace and Glory, the Church on Earth, and the Assembly of the first-born in Heaven: therefore do you (my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) suffer them to come to me. Now of what force could this reason of admitting them to Christ be, if Christ had not meant that these very Infants did belong to the Kingdom of God? If we should once yield that Christ meant only that those which were like Infants (in innocency and humility) were Heirs of the Kingdom, then we must conceive that Christ had in his mind this shallow and sapless Argument, Grown men are Members of my Kingdom, therefore Let Infants come to me. What ridiculous rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning would this be? and what an imputation of folly and childishness would this poor shift
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:30732:230"/> lay upon the spotlesse and perfect wisdom of God?</p>
                           <p>Let us keep then to the true and antient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of this Text, and all other parallel places, which urge the Interest of Infants in the Kingdom of God, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 13, 14. and <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14. <hi>[of such is the Kingdom of God]</hi> that is, of these and other such Infants; and therefore do you receive these and other Infants, and suffer my followers to bring their Infants to me.</p>
                           <p>The place in <hi>Luke</hi> answers the vain cavil of those that say they were not Infants, but big Lads or youths that were brought to Christ. For <hi>Luke</hi> saith they were Infants, <gap reason="foreign">

Little Children, which is the word used in all the other places, and <hi>Luke</hi> interprets it here of Infants; and they came not of themselves to Christ, but were carried, and Christ took them up in his arms (saith <hi>Mark)</hi> and the Apostles were offended for the bringing of Infants; and how could they have been offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at them any more than other Persons, if they had been men of understanding, and not Infants indeed?</p>
                           <p>And that Infants were indeed Members of the Church, is further manifest from those Titles before mentioned: for (as I said) they are called Disciples, Christians, Saints, the blessed of the Lord, and what are these but Church-members? For what is a Church but a combination of Disciples, Christians, and Saints, that are visibly and professedly such? and shall not all the Church be baptised into one body? or shall half the Church be baptised, and the other half be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptised
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:30732:231"/> when the Church is setled and in peace? who hath heard of such a thing? what a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Church would this be!</p>
                           <p>Then we will conclude the first Argument thus; If Infants were accounted Disciples, and Christians, and Saints, and the blessed of the Lord, and Members of the Church of God, in the dayes of Christ and his Apostles; then they were baptised in those dayes. But they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted so in those daies, and consequently they were baptised in those dayes.</p>

                           <p>From these baptised Housholds. Note,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That we read of more baptised than are said to have professed faith before baptism. Neither the Houshold of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> nor any of <hi>Lydia's</hi> Houshold are said to have professed faith, but only <hi>Lydia</hi> her self.

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:30732:234"/> in Christ, I hope our very Adversaries (in this controversie) will grant, that Infants are comprehended, and that all Infants shall not be damned that dy in their infancy. So when the Scripture saith, the Apostles baptised families, we should judge, they did it according to the Covenant of Grace; and consequently they denyed not baptism to Infants. Even as when we read that <hi>Abraham</hi> or any Jew circumcised his Family, we are to conceive they did it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant of Grace, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to their Infants also, who were equally concerned in the Covenant with themselves.</p>

'Tis a Ministers Action, an outward Action, and meant of visible outward Disciples; to make them Disciples in heart, grace is required, and that's the work of God, they shall be all taught of God. But when Christ sayes to men, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple ye; the meaning is, make them visible Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Gather them into the Church; and this is done by baptism, which I have proved to be an initiating Ordinance; and you know the old phrase for baptism was Christening, and the name given at baptism is called the Christen-name, or Christian name; which shews, that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism in time of old hath been reckoned for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipling or Christianing of people.</p>
                           <p>This exposition takes off all cavils of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarie against this Argument, as if all should be first taught, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, Christ gave this commission to the eleven Apostles, who were most of them Jews, and acquainted with the doctrin of circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the privileges of Infants by vertue of the covenant of grace; and they could as easily understand Infants to be comprehended in this saying <hi>(Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.) as easily (I say) as if it had been said to them, Disciple ye Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, circumcising them. If it had been so said, every one could have gathered it to have been meant not only of Parents, but their Infants also. And though it be said, Go ye, &amp;c. bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them, the case is all one to them that were thorowly acquainted with the privileges of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants before, and had seen all the love that Christ had shewed to Infants in their fight, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:30732:236"/> of their murmuring against those that brought them to him.</p>
                           <p>Note further, that when I say Nations are to be made Disciples by baptism, I do not mean that Heathen Nations, and all Infants are to be forced to baptism promiscuously without any Doctrin of baptism first preached; but they ought to be first taught the doctrin of Christ and of his baptism, and then upon the submission of Parents to baptism, upon perswasion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction fore-going, then they ought to bring their Infants to baptism, and their whole Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds; As <hi>Abraham</hi> after he was taught the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of circumcision, caused his whole Family to be circumcised.</p>

                           <p>Infants of Believers were circumcised under the Law: therefore they are to be baptised un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel.</p>
                           <p>Grounds of this Argument.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Baptism is placed in the room of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; as I have before proved.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. As circumcision was a sign of the covenant made with Infants, so baptism is a sign thereof. This is also before proved. Infants had once right to the covenant, who took it from them?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The subject of baptism is larger than the subject of circumcision, and more are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, than were to be circumcised, As the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male sex, and all Nations; then baptism is large enough for Infants also.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. All the privileges of the Jews were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon the Gentiles by the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 11, 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. Hence the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:30732:236"/> is called a better Testament, with better promises, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. chapt. 8. 6.</p>
                           <p>And 'twas a privilege to the Jews to have right to the sign of grace in Infancy, <hi>Romans</hi> 3. 1, 2.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Otherwise Infants would be losers by the comming of Christ, and be put in a worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than the Jewish Infants were; and Grace would be larger under the Law than under the Gospel.</p>
                           <p>Is it likely that <hi>Moses</hi> should be better to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants than Christ? Is Judaism a better state for them than Christianity? doth this sound like Gospel or glad tydings to the world? Is Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity better for Parents, and worse for children? This were a wound, and blot, and dishonour to the Gospel; and enough to harden the heart of a Jew against Christ for ever.</p>
                           <p>I might easily inlarge here: but I have said enough of this Question; and have plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That Infants of Christians must be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised.</p>

                           <p>1. Sprinkling is as significant as dipping. For as a little bit of bread in the Lords Supper is as <note place="margin">

Hence Christs blood which is signified by baptism is called the blood of sprinkling <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. Hence also Christ is said to sprinkle many Nations, <hi>Isay</hi> 52. 15. and hence in the Covenant of grace (which baptism signs and seals) the Lord is said to sprinkle clean water upon his people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ob.</hi> But 'tis said, we are buried with him by baptism into death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. and dipping
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:30732:239"/> more resembles a burial than sprinkling.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. We must not presse the resemblance too far: For if our abiding under water in our baptism must answer Christs burial in exact and absolute representation in every point, then as Christ lay three daies and three nights in the grave, so we must lye three daies and three nights under the water: which if practised will quickly put the dispute to an end. But the scope of the place is to shew, that one end of our baptism is to seal our Communion with Christ in his death, baptism being a sign of Christs bloud, and consequently of his death and burial, which should mind us of our death to sin, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>2. Sprinkling better resembles burial than dipping can. For in burial the dead body is not dipped and plunged in the earth; but the dust and earth is rather powred upon it, as water is powred upon the face by sprinkling in baptism. But doth not the Lords Supper also signifie Christs death as well as baptism? yet a dispute about the quantity of the bread and wine would be thought ridiculous.</p>
                           <p>Thus I have shewed sprinkling to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently significant.</p>
                           <p>2. Sprinkling comes nearer to Scripture-expression in the point of baptising, than dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping doth. For we have a Type of baptism in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> the passing of the children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> under the Pillar of Cloud, and through the red Sea, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. indeed the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were dipt in the water like a Stone, they sank like Lead; but the <hi>Israelites</hi> did but touch the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:30732:239"/> with their feet; and the <hi>Israelites</hi> were not dipt in the cloud, only they might be sprinkled with some drops of dew that fell from it, as our Infants are sprinkled in baptism with drops of water; yet the Text saith, They were all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised unto <hi>Moses</hi> in the cloud, and in the Sea. And the Thing signified by baptism is expresly call'd sprinkling of Nations, a sprinkling of clean water, the blood of sprinkling, as is before noted; and I suppose 'tis no where called dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the Scripture; Therefore I say sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling comes nearer to Scripture-expression than dipping doth. Yet (as I noted) we must not presse Types and Metaphors too far, lest at last we bring baptism to be a swimming above water: for baptism is likened to <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark also, as well as to Christs burial, and is called a figure like to that Ark, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20, 21. what work might a wild fancy make of this Text, if it should strain this figure too far, and go about to make baptism to resemble <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark in every point! As some have gone about to make bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism to resemble circumcision in every point, because we say it succeeds it, and resembles it in many considerable circumstances, though not in all. I will adde one more ground.</p>
                           <p>3. To dip the Person baptised is either dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, or uncomly, or both; dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the coldnesse of our climate, and the tendernesse of our Insants; uncomly, for if we should dip men and woman as our Adversaries do, and would have us to do, we must either dip them in their clothes, or naked. If in their clothes (as I think they do) this is to baptise
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:30732:240"/> clothes, rather than men; for the clothes have the water first, and it sinks thorow, and comes to the body at the second hand, and to baptise clothes, is thought to be no better than bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Bells. But if we dip them naked, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comly would it be to see naked men and women unstripped and undressed in the face of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation? I should be loth to practise such a custom in the name of the Blessed Trinity. I conclude then, that sprinkling of the face is far better than dipping of the whole body under water. Allude <hi>John</hi> 13. 8, 9, 10.</p>

                        <p>There are three great errors of the times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Doctrine of baptism.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Against the perpetuity of the baptism of water; which error is confuted in the 2d. Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Against the ordinary necessity of it; and this error is overthrown in the 3d. Question.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Against the subject of it; many deny the right of Infants to it; and this error is crushed in the 5th. Question.</p>
                        <p>Therefore beware of them all three, and at present I will give you a special Caveat against the last, <hi>viz.</hi> denial of Infant-baptism, because it rageth more in <hi>England</hi> than the other. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:30732:240"/>
'tis an error in the subject of a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and such error is dangerous.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> error concerning Christ, was in the subject of the Mediator-ship. They acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Messiah or Mediator, but they erred in the subject or person, they knew not which was He, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 35. This error in the subject was their ruine.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> acknowledge a God, a Deity; but they erre in the subject of the Godhead, they worship <hi>Mahomet,</hi> they know not who is the true God. As the <hi>Athenians, Acts</hi> 17. 23. This is the ruine of thousands.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Arrians</hi> acknowledge a Saviour, but they erre in the subject, yea in a part only of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this office; for they confesse Christs Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, but deny his Divine Nature, they deny the half of the Person.</p>
                        <p>The Deniers of the Ministry say, They own a Ministry: but they deny the Ministry: they erre in the subject of the office: for when the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is who are to be Ministers, they say, Those that have inward motions to Preach, &amp;c. but we say, more truly, Those that have inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and an outward calling both together, or both in one Person.</p>
                        <p>Even so, when the Question is, who are to be baptised in the Nations of the world? Those that deny Infant-baptism, say, Grown persons only, that can professe their Faith. We say, and that more truly, Both Grown persons and their Infants.</p>
                        <p>Thus you see this error is in the subject of a Fundamental Doctrine.</p>
                        <pb n="324" facs="tcp:30732:241"/>
                        <p> Yea 'tis much to be feared, that some of those which deny Infant-baptism, do in the sight of God, and of their own Consciences, deny all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of water.</p>
                        <p>For the practice and works of many do deny it, though their tongues confesse it: for wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And for those that are re-baptised, I will put a case to them. Suppose a Jew in <hi>Moses</hi> time should have denied Infant-circumcision, and should have pleaded as some do. We do not deny all Circumcision, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we differ from other Jews about the time of Circumcising: How would this have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? should not that Soul have been cut off from Gods people? The case is the same in baptism. It is not much like the error of the wild <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:30732:241"/> meaning of Scripture, that Infants ought to be baptised, as is before proved; but this sense of Scripture is denied, and this error goes about to maintain that no Infants should be baptised. 2.

                           <p>It is a greater error than denial of Infant-cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was, in time of old.

                           <p>Now Infant-baptism is greater than Infant-circumcision, by how much the Gospel is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Law, and the despising thereof more dangerous, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 28, 29.</p>

                           <p>Quest. <hi>Whether may a man dye in this error a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Infant-baptism (or any other considerable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror) and be saved?</hi>

                              <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. All those servants of God, whose er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are recorded in Scripture, left their errors when they were pressed and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>orted from them. The case of all Christs Disciples, who were ignorant of Christs Death and Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet afterward Preached the Resurrection and Death of Christ.</p>
                           <p>2. 'Tis not reveiled how far a man may erre, and be saved. I suppose 'tis purposely hid, that men should not presume in error. There are two places of Scripture which (of all other) come nearest to this Question, yet do not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely determine it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
                           <pb n="336" facs="tcp:30732:247"/>
                           <p> Yet these places speak not of willfull error: nor do they express, whether the persons they speak of shall retract their error in this life, or the life to come?</p>
                           <p>3. I suppose we must determine this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to the state of the Person erring: If he erre of mere weakness and ignorance, he may be saved; but if, of wilfullness, he cannot be saved, compare <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 12. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 8, 9. And 'tis certain, a man may be in the state of Grace, and yet in great error, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1, 4 the case of Christs Disciples, who erred about the death, resurrection, and divine nature of Christ, as I shewed in my discourse of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral nature of Fundamentals.</p>
                           <p>Yea a man that hath less error may be grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; and the man that hath more error may be gracious, as I formerly shewed in the case of <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Apollos. Judas</hi> knew more than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos;</hi> yet <hi>Apollos</hi> had more Grace than <hi>Judas:</hi> though he knew the baptism of <hi>John</hi> only, not that of Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.</p>
                           <p>We conclude then, that if a man have an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart, and erre of mere ignorance, would repent of his error, if he were convinced of it; that mans error cannot damn him. Yet 'tis not reveiled how far a gracious man may erre, and how long he may continue in it; lest men should presume in error. But this is certain, the best have some errors in this life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. 12. and this is certain, that the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be a day of revelation of those things which was never known before, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>[the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God,]</hi> 1 Cor. 13.</p>
                           <pb n="337" facs="tcp:30732:247"/>
                           <p> And the more charitable any man is, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 1, 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>[Charity ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth all things.]</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Yet we must distinguish betwixt an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Person and his error; we owe no charity to the error, but only to the Person. We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Error to Hell, and give up the Person to Heaven, as the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Here he gives a mans error, and his works to the fire; but the Person and the Man himself to Heaven. The Work shall be burnt; but the Man shall be saved.</p>

                     <p>For the proof hereof, compare three places of Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. with <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. &amp; <hi>John</hi> 13. 20. The first place layes down Christ as the Foundation; and the next shews, that Christ having sent out twelve Ministers, assures them, that to receive them as Ministers, is to receive him and his Father; and to despise them, is to despise him and his Father; and the third place makes it plain, that what Christ hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of those twelve Ministers is extended to all other Ministers, whom he should send after them. <hi>[He that receiveth whomsoever I shall send,</hi> (for so it is in the Greek reading) <hi>receiveth me,</hi>

                        <hi>and him that sent me.]</hi> These are high sayings, and do magnifie the Office of the Ministry, as one of the weightier matters of Christianity.

                        <hi>Grounds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because Christ and his Apostles, and <hi>John</hi> the Baptist (who were all Master-builders of of the House of God) began to build with this Principle. They magnifie this Office of the Ministry, as a means of Advancing Christian Religion, and of founding the Church; they all plead they were Ministers of God, distinct by Office from other men that were never imployed in this Ministry; yea they wrought Miracles to make men believe, that they were men in Office, entrusted by God with the work of the Ministry, and that their work did not belong to every one.</p>

                     <p>And <hi>Nicodemus</hi> looks upon this as the design of Miracles to prove the worker of them to be a Teacher come from God; a man in Office, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 2. and would God work Miracles to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the mind of men a right apprehension of this Office, if it were not a matter of very great moment?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Because it is a comprehensive Doctrin: a vast and large truth, hath many great Mysteries in the womb thereof, as, The doctrin of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation: for what doth God send his Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors for, but for peace and good will towards men? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19. The doctrin of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: for Ministers are sent to turn the hearts of men to God, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 17, 18 The doctrin of Knowledge, Faith and Perseverance: for what is the Ministry for, but to promote these Graces in the Souls of men? <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13, 14. The doctrin of the Sacraments: for what are Sacraments without Stewards of God to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>[Ministers of Christ, Stewards of the Mysteries of God]</hi> The doctrin of Church-government, and Spiritual rule: for how can Church-government be without Church-Officers? <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 12. The doctrin of Church-order: for there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but confusion in that Church, where
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:30732:249"/> there is no Minister, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 34.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Because it is strictly urged: The receiving of this Doctrine and Office is enjoyned upon life and death; Temporal and Eternal punishments belong to the despisers of it, as may be easily collected out of these Scriptures, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 31, &amp;c. compared with, <hi>Jude</hi> 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 14, 15. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Because 'tis one of the great ends of Christs Death and Resurrection, one end of his Descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Ascension, to perpetuate and establish this Office in the Church, that we might have Pastors and Teachers, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10 11. <hi>[He that Descended, the same Ascended, gave gifts to men, and gave some to be Pastors and Teachers.]</hi> that they might Preach Repentance, and Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins in his name, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 46, 47.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Because Christ himself submitted to this Doctrine: he himself would not Preach out of Office, and without a special call from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18, 43. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4, 5. <hi>John</hi> 8. 42. <hi>[I came not of my self, but he sent me.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Surely if any might have pleaded the Spirit and come of himself, Christ might have done it, and have refused to be called, but he glories in this, that he did not call himself, nor glorifie himself to be a Minister, but was truly sent, and put into Office.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Because the blessed Trinity have subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed their name to this Doctrine and Office of the Ministry: The Commission given to Ministers is signed with this reverend name, and they are to act in this name, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. We have the name of the Father and Son subscribed to this Office,

                        <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. <hi>John</hi> 13. 20. and the name of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 20. 28.</p>
                     <p>This Name at the foot of any truth, portends same weighty Glorious matter; fit for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Men and Angels, as I said before.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Because the Office of the Ministry is the greatest means of Saving-faith and Saving-grace, which is under Heaven. Indeed Parents, and Relations, and Friends, may be happy Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of turning men to God: but none like to a Minister in Office for this purpose. Of all men Ministers have greatest advantage to work upon many and to win them to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 17, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Because all publick Ordinances and this Office, do stand or fall together. To overthrow the one, is to overthrow all the other.

                     <p>The reason why God doth not teach imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, but useth man, and puts men in his stead is two-fold. 1.

They were all sent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their Gifts, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 2. <hi>[He sent them to preach the Kingdom of God,]</hi> and chap. 10. 1.</p>
                           <p>I suppose none will deny, that Christ was a Gifted man, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. chapt. 2. 3. yet he had not his Office by his Gifts, but by special Call joyned with his Gifts; compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4, 5. with <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 53, 54. and chapt. 7. 28, 29. <hi>[He hath sent me.]</hi> Now what need is there of a send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing besides Gifts, if Gifts could put men into Office, without special Call or special sending?</p>
                           <p>Hence the Names and Titles given to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in the Scripture, are such as imply and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose a special Call and Commission, besides Gifts and Qualifications.

And all these are names of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and require and presuppose a special call and commission in the subject, or person entrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Office. Who ever heard of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour without a Commission? Hence is that of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>[How can they preach except they be sent?]</hi> Some have strangely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted this Text, as if by Sending were meant only a Providential sending, as if Gods permitting a Gifted man to come among a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:30732:252"/> were sending: but thus Seducers and false Teachers are sent; they are permitted to come without sending.

                        <pb n="352" facs="tcp:30732:255"/>
                        <p> We may then draw a solid Argument for the perpetuity of the Ministry, from this Text <hi>(Eph.</hi> 4.) and reason thus,</p>
                        <p>Either Apostles, or Prophets, or Evangelists, or Pastors and Teachers were to continue in the Church, so long as the Church continues.</p>
                        <p>But neither Apostles, nor Prophets, nor Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists were so to continue: for where are any such in the world?</p>
                        <p>Therefore Pastors and Teachers (ordinary Ministers) were to continue so long as the Church continues.</p>
                        <p>And this may be the meaning of that Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Prophesie, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 30. 20. <hi>[yet shall not thy Teachers be removed into a Corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy Teachers.]</hi> Here God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Church either that the Teachers shall never cease, nor wholly dis-continue; or else, that they shall never be persecuted, so as they had been in Times past, by the Enemies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and if the latter sense be the meaning, then it necessarily includes the former, for if God will ever keep his Ministers from obscurity, then much more he will alway keep them in office, else how shall the people see them as Teachers?</p>
                        <p>Obj. <hi>But 'tis said in the New Covenant,</hi> Jer. 31. 34. [they shall teach no more, &amp;c.]</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. No more: that is, not only: the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                              <hi>The right Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Text, Jer.</hi> 31. 34.</note> of men shall not go alone, but shall be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the teaching of Gods spirit. For <hi>[no more]</hi> is put for (not only) in several places, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 28. <hi>c.</hi> 35. 10. <hi>[thy name shall be called no more Jacob.]</hi> that is, not only <hi>Jacob:</hi> for <hi>Jacob</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:30732:255"/>
                           <hi>Jacob</hi> in Scripture after this in many places, and in all ages ever since, so when 'tis said, <hi>[they shall teach no more every man his Neighbour.]</hi> the meaning is, man shall not teach alone, but God will teach too. The external and internal teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall go together: shall not be in vain.</p>
                        <p>2. When this Covenant is repeated in the New Testament, this phrase <hi>[no more]</hi> is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and instead of <hi>[teach no more]</hi> 'tis set down <hi>[shall not teach,] Heb.</hi> 8. 11. And this word (not) though a note of Negation, is not alwaies abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, but comparative only sometimes, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies often in Scripture (not only) not chiefly. As <hi>John</hi> 7. 16. <hi>[Jesus said, my Doctrine is not mine.]</hi> that is, <hi>[not mine only.]</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>[Christ sent me not to baptise.]</hi> that is, not only. So here in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>[They shall not teach,]</hi> that is, not man only; but God also: as 'tis said <hi>vers.</hi> 10. <hi>[saith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. This place cannot be taken absolutely for (never any more) but comparatively for (not only.) Which I affirm upon sure grounds.</p>
                        <p>Grounds of this Interpretation.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because the same Prophet prophesies, that outward and inward Teaching shall go together in the daies of the Gospel, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>[I will give you Pastors according to my own heart, &amp;c.]</hi> when shall these Pastors be given? in the daies of the Gospel, when the Ark and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of <hi>Moses</hi> shall cease. <hi>vers.</hi> 16. <hi>[in those daies, saith the Lord, they shall say no more the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, &amp;c.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now this Prophet would not contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:30732:256"/> and cry up, and cry down Pastors in a breath.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Because in the purest Gospel-times, when the Saints were taught of God, they were taught also by an outward Ministry, <hi>viz.</hi> by Christ and his Apostles, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 47. yea after the giving of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 4. <hi>[the Ministry of the word.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Because, otherwise interpreted, it would destroy, all private teaching of our Families, Children and Brethren. Yea this private teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seems to be chiefly meant in the Text, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>[they shall teach no more every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother.]</hi> every man, private men, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Because, if otherwise interpreted, it would destroy the Scriptures also; for that is an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teaching too; and the place speaks of writing the law in the heart; not in paper, &amp;c. And how many have stretched this Text to the overthrow of the whole Bible, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to light within them. But read, <hi>Isay</hi> 8. 20. <hi>[If they speak not according to this word, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no light in them.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Because we are assured in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (of which Testament this Prophet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed) that outward teaching and Teachers shall last to the end of the world, as is before proved out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Now the Scripture cannot contradict it self; cannot say and un-say; for 'tis a sure word, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rule, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>[sure word of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <pb n="355" facs="tcp:30732:256"/> 6. Because outward Teaching doth continue to this very day, as is clear to experience. The people of God in all Ages have owned it, and do own it as an Ordinance of God; and those that are most Spiritual, do most delight in it. Let your Consciences speak, Did your hearts never burn within you at the preaching of the word? Have not the convictions of God fallen upon you? Have not your Souls been caught up to Heaven in this Ordinance? Have you not many a time been forced to confesse, 'Tis the voyce of God that hath spoken to us, and God is among us of a truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24, 25.</p>
                        <p>Now if this Prophet had prophecyed, that outward teaching should not continue; and yet it doth continue; He had been a false Prophet: but we know him to be a true Prophet, and inspired of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
                        <p>Ob. <hi>But Saint</hi> John <hi>tells Gods people, that they need not the teaching of any man, because they have the anointing of the Spirit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iude,</hi> (four great Apostles) do bear witness, that Gods people do need external teaching by man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12, 13. chapt. 3. 1. <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 19, 21, 22. <hi>Iude</hi> 3.</p>
                        <p>Surely, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> would not contradict all these four Apostles.</p>
                        <p>2. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> knew very well, that his Lord and Master was for outward teaching in the daies of the Gospel: for it was Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> that wrote those sayings of Christ concerning outward teaching, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 47. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 20. <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17.</p>
                        <pb n="356" facs="tcp:30732:257"/>
                        <p> Surely, He that wrote the Doctrin of Christ, would not write against it: Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was no Preacher of new Doctrine, 2 <hi>Iohn, v.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
                        <p>3. When Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote the Revelation (a Book of things to come after his time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 19.) He prophecyes of Outward Teaching by the Angels (or Ministers) of the Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6, 7, 8. by Angel, he means Ministers, as appears chapt. 1. 20. with chapt. 2. and chapt. 3.</p>
                        <p>4. In this very Epistle Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth the Saints himself; and urgeth them to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on outward teaching, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 6. <hi>[He that is of God heareth us.]</hi> Yea if all outward teaching had been needless, then Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Epistle had been needless, and consequently the Scripture had been needless; for this Epistle is part of the Scripture. Is it likely that Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> (a man inspired of God) should teach the Saints, and cry down teaching; practise it, and cry it down? Is it likely he would say to the Saints, Indeed I teach you, but 'tis a needless thing that I do: you may choose whether you will heed me or no, for you are taught by the Spirit.</p>
                        <p>By all this it appears, that Saint <hi>John</hi> doth not mean, That the Saints have no need at all of outward teaching; for Pastors and teachers are principally intended for the good of the Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12. <hi>[for the perfecting of the Saints.]</hi> Outward teaching confirms, and helps the Saints <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 21, 22. <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 27. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 10. and these <hi>Thessalonians</hi> were very spiritual and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent believers, who needed the outward teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to perfect them, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 7, 8.</p>
                        <pb n="357" facs="tcp:30732:257"/>
                        <p> Therefore we must seek out another meaning of this passage of St. <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. Now I will set down the right interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent text 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27.</note> of this Text, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 27. <hi>[ye need not that any man teach you.]</hi> that is, Ye need not any man teach you otherwise, than as you have been taught by Gods word and Spirit; ye need not go to Seducers to learn a new Religion: for St. <hi>Iohn</hi> is warning them of many Antichrists and Seducers, in this chapter, and in the verse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this text, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>[These things have I writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to you concerning them that seduce you.]</hi> and then it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>[but the Anointing abideth in you; you need not that any man teach you: and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.]</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> cannot mean, You need not be taught by me or any Minister of Christ; but he means, You have been taught the truth already, by me and other Ministers of Christ, and you have been convinced of the truth of what we taught, by the anointing of the Spirit of Christ, who hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed your eyes with eye-salve that you may see: and now you need not that any man teach you otherwise; that any man teach you a new Religion; for you have the truth already, and by the power of the Spirit of grace you shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the truth.

                        <p> The chiefest and highest work of a Minister is, to Preach. This is more difficult and weighty than the other.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Because it is a mark of Seducers and false Teachers, to take upon them to be Preachers and Ministers without a Call, <hi>John</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3. <hi>[He that entreth not by the door into the Sheep-fold, but climbeth in, &amp;c. the same is a Thief and a Robber.] Acts</hi> 15. 24. <hi>[Certain men went out from us.]</hi> were not sent out, but went of their own heads, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>[transforming themselves into Ministers of Christ.] Rev.</hi> 2. 2, 20. <hi>[Thou hast tryed them which say they are Apostles and are not, and had found them Lyars.

                        <p>We conclude then, That this office is not common to all: but peculiar to some: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to such as are both Gifted and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28, 29. <hi>[God hath set some in the Church, some Pastors and Teachers: Are all Apostles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?]</hi> This Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation imports a vehement denyal.</p>
                        <p>Objections.</p>
                        <p>Ob. <hi>But the Scripture allows every Gifted man to minister the same, as a Good Steward, and to speak as the Oracles of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 10, 11?</p>
                        <p>I suppose the Gifted Lay-Preacher had his first rise and beginning from a mistake of this Text. Therefore note the Answer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Not one word of preaching in this Text, either expressed or implyed; It speaks
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:30732:260"/> not at all of preaching, and therefore it cannot justifie private men to exercise their Gifts in preaching.</p>
                        <p>2. By (Gift) is meant here, not the Gift of Preaching, but the Gift of Hospitality, and Liberality, as appears by the next Verses going before, and by the scope of the place, <hi>[Above all things have fervent Charity, &amp;c. use Hospitality one to another, &amp;c.]</hi> and then it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>[As every man hath received the Gift, &amp;c.]</hi> Yea the Greek Participle <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> couples both Verses together, and joyns the ninth and tenth Verses in one sentence. So that according to the Greek reading, it may be thus Englished, Use Hospitality one to another without grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, Ministring it one to another, as every man hath received the Gift, &amp;c. that is, the Gift of Hospitality before-mentioned. Such a Gift as we read of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>[given to Hospitality,]</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 13.</p>
                        <p>3. By the word (Ministring) here, (in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.) is meant a mutual improving and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Gift of Hospitality in Common duties and actions of love: such a ministring as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to women, and is far from preaching; for we read of a woman ministring to Christ, <hi>[and she arose, and ministred unto them,]</hi> Mat. 8 15. will any be so senseless as to gather from hence that this woman preached to Christ, and to those that were with him? Again, 'tis said, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 2, 3. <hi>[certain women ministred unto him of their substance,]</hi> that is, were kind to him, and entertained him with the best provision they could make, and furnished him with what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries they could.</p>
                        <pb n="364" facs="tcp:30732:261"/>
                        <p> 4. By (Stewards of Grace) is not meant Preachers: for every man and woman that hath Grace is such a Steward, whether he be Gifted for preaching or not. But every lawfull Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not only a Steward of Grace (which is common to all Saints) but is also a Steward of the Mysteries of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. a Steward of Gods house, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 41.</p>
                        <p>Now there's a Great difference betwixt these Stewards and the other: For the Stewards of Gods house are set over the Stewards of his Grace, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 42. <hi>[whom his Lord shall make Ruler over his Houshold,]</hi> Acts 20. 28. <hi>[over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Overseers.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All the Members of Gods house (both men and women, the weak and the strong, the Gifted and the Un-gifted) are Stewards of his Grace; he hath committed his grace to their trust and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; they have all their Talents: But the Stewards of Gods house are more than Stewards of Grace; for they are Stewards of his Word and Sacraments.</p>
                        <p>5. By (speaking as the Oracles of God, <hi>v.</hi> 11.) is not meant Preaching, but (according to the scope of the place) a private familiar language or discourse in their way of Hospitality: kind and good speech in entertaining one another: Speech seasoned with salt, with Grace and truth, as the Oracles or Word of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 28, 29. <hi>[no corrupt communication, &amp;c. but that which is good, &amp;c. that it may minister grace to the Hearers.]</hi> The scope of the Apostle is to direct them exactly in this point of Hospitality, how to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves each to other both in word and deed:
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:30732:261"/> speaking when they speak as Gods word, and ministring when they minister, of their substance, and that bountifully, as of the Ability which God hath given them; according as God hath blessed every man in his outward Estate; and as every man hath received the gift of Liberality and sincere courtesie, or brotherly kindnesse, or Affability.</p>
                        <p>Were there lesse preaching, and more Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality among our Lay-Preachers, God would be more glorified, and his Church more edified, and the bowels of his Saints more refreshed.</p>
                        <p>6. This very Apostle in the same Epistle, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and appropriates preaching and feeding of the flock to Ministers and Elders, such as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and therefore he makes it not common to all that can do it, <hi>chapt.</hi> 5. 1, 2. <hi>[The Elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp;c. Feed the Flock of God which is among you, &amp;c.]</hi> Feed, that is, with the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For <hi>Peter</hi> useth to them the same word that Christ put in his Commission, <hi>John</hi> 21. 15, 16. <hi>[Feed my sheep, feed my lambs, feed my sheep.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis an abuse then of the Apostle <hi>Peters</hi> words, to wrest them to the maintaining of an un-called and un-ordained Preacher. For <hi>Peter</hi> himself had a Commission besides his Gifts: and when he speaks of feeding the Flock, he directs his Charge to the Elders of the Church who were men in Office, ordained men, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. <hi>[or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Elders in every Church.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ob. <hi>But 'tis said,</hi> (Acts 8. 4.) <hi>The Church at Jerusalem were all scattered abroad, except the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi>
                           <pb n="366" facs="tcp:30732:262"/>
                           <hi>and they that were scattered went every where preaching the word.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Though it be said, They were all scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, <hi>v.</hi> 1. yet it is not said, All that were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered preached: but this is the phrase, They that were scattered preached, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>[They that were scattered went every where preaching.]</hi> that is, Those (among them) that were Preachers, or Ministers, preached. Were they but two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters among them, and they had Preached; this Scripture had been fulfilled.</p>
                        <p>2. There is but one of these Preachers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and he <hi>(viz. Philip)</hi> was an Evangelist, and an ordained man, compare <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 5. with <hi>chap.</hi> 21. 8. and <hi>Acts</hi> 6. Guesse at all the rest by this one.</p>
                        <p>3. 'Tis said in another place, that some of these that were scattered were men of <hi>Cyrene, Acts</hi> 11. 19, 20, 21. and one of them is expressed by name in the 13th. Chapter, and he was a Prophet, a man in office, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1. <hi>[Certain Prophets and Teachers, Lucius of Cyrene, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naen, &amp;c.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Though it be said (they all were scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) yet the meaning is not that All the Church were scattered. For there was a Church still at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when they were gone, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 19, 20, 21, 22. Tydings was brought to the Church at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> of what these scattered Preachers had done. And this Church consisted not only of Apostles, but also of Disciples and Brethren, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 26, 27, 30.</p>
                        <p>5. We conclude then: by this phrase <hi>[All were scattered except the Apostles]</hi> is not meant
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:30732:262"/> all the Saints, but All the Preachers, all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters: for there were the seventy, and many other Prophets and Evangelists at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the twelve Apostles.</p>
                        <p>And seeing Ministers of all others have been most aimed at by Persecutors: It is most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the most of these that fled from <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> were persecuted Ministers; though others also might be forced to fly with them. For <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> aimed most at the Preachers, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                        <p>The reason why the Apostles staid behind with the Church, might be their courage and valour above other Ministers.</p>
                        <p>6. These scattered Preachers did Baptise as well as Preach, therefore they were Ministers, Stewards of the Word and Sacraments, men in office, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 12, 13,—17.</p>
                        <p>Obj. <hi>But All the Saints may Prophesie,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 31. <hi>[ye may all Prophesie one by one.]</hi> Ergo <hi>Gifted men may.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. The word (All) is to be limited and restrained to the Prophets there spoken of, <hi>vers.</hi> 29, 32. <hi>[Let the Prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. And the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets,]▪ [ye all may Prophesie.]</hi> that is, All ye Prophets may Prophesie. But all the Saints at <hi>Corinth</hi> were not Prophets: as the same Apostle in the same Epistle teacheth, <hi>chap.</hi> 12. 29. <hi>[are all Apostles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?]</hi> How doth the Apostle slight that foolish Principle, That all should be Prophets and Teachers? He even disdains at it, and seems to wonder that any Christian should entertain so monstrous an opinion?</p>
                        <pb n="368" facs="tcp:30732:263"/>
                        <p> 2. Those Prophets in the Apostles dayes were extraordinary men: not only above common Christians, but also above common Ministers. For they could fore-tell future Events, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Scripture <hi>ex tempore,</hi> by immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, by special revelation, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 27, 28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 29, 30.</p>
                        <p>Therefore by Prophets and their Prophesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot be meant, all sorts of Christians, and the exercise of their Gifts.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true: women are forbidden to speak in the Church, in the same Chapter, which yet doth not allow all men; no more than (when women are forbidden to adorn themselves with outward adorning of plaiting the hair, wearing of gold, &amp;c.) men are allowed to adorn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in excesse, and pride. And who will say, All men may administer the Sacraments, because no woman may? say not then, All men may preach, because no woman may. For this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes as much for the preaching of Giftless men, as the Gifted.</p>
                        <p>Besides, There might be some extraordinary Women-Prophetesses in <hi>Corinth:</hi> such as <hi>Miriam, Huldah, Anna,</hi> the Daughters of <hi>Philip, Acts</hi> 21. 9. and these the Apostle might command to private Prophesying; and if Prophesying wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men might not Prophesie in publick, much lesse might other women that were not Prophetesses, meddle in publick, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34.</p>
                        <p>Many other Objections have been started in these times against the propriety of Ministers, in their office and work; which are all answered by learned men: and having spoken to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal

                           </gap>, that is, he shall have him a Ruler that was none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now what needed <hi>Titus</hi> be left at <hi>Crete</hi> to ordain Elders, if the People might have made themselves Elders without ordination? Yea in the Apostles daies a man could not be so much as a Church-Deacon without ordination, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. <hi>[whom we may appoint or ordain over this business.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Who ever heard, or read of an un-ordained Elder in the New Testament? The Elders in every Church and City were ordained, and ordained by men, by the Guides and Ministers of the Church, which is plain in the places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready urged, <hi>viz. Acts</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>[every Church, every City.]</hi> And by Elders are meant Overseers and Feeders of the Flock or Church of God, Ministers of the Word, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 17,—28.</p>
                        <p>The word Presbyter, or Elder, is Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically taken for a Minister, (not Etymological<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for one that is older than others, as some cavil.) For (as I said,) They are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Elders who were none before: And a yong man cannot be ordained by men to old age: but to office and honour.</p>
                        <p>Ordination cannot make men old: but it makes Youth, Honourable by Office; as Old men are by Age.</p>
                        <pb n="371" facs="tcp:30732:264"/>
                        <p> Hence it was that yong <hi>Timothy</hi> was not to be despised for his youth, because he was an Elder by Office, and his Office had put Honour upon him; and this Office was given him by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. which place (compared with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14.) shews, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was ordained by the Eldership, and that <hi>Paul</hi> and they were joyned together in this work of ordination, and this ordination put him into office.</p>
                        <p>The substance of ordination doth consist prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Proving and Send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p n="1">1.

                        <p>Some of the Prophets and Apostles might be <note place="margin">The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Call not perpetual, but extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.</note> called immediately by God without men: but they were extraordinary men: and when we see such men, such Persons again, such workers of Miracles, let us expect such a Call.

They did not wait, till God should call men immediately: but they ordained Ministers themselves, and gave order to those whom they ordained, to ordain others after them, that there might be a constant succession of Ministers in the Church: yea they would not suffer one Church to be without an ordained Minister, <hi>Acts</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Thus we have found out what Ordination is, <note place="margin">Ordination described.</note>
                           <hi>viz.</hi> A Ministerial sending of a fit Person, about the work of the Ministry; after serious Tryal of his gifts and life, and this is the ordinary Call to the Ministry. When God hath fitted a man, This Ordination by men, makes him a Minister: Ordination by men that stand in Gods stead, and send men, as though God did send them: Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by Gods Embassadors, appointment to this office by men of God; is the true ordinary call to this office, as is before proved.</p>
                        <p>And though the substance of Ordination doth <note place="margin">Of its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> chiefly consist in proving and sending: yet we must see to the well-being thereof, as well as to its being: and for the well-being of Ordination we must diligently observe all its Scriptural-circumstances; which cannot be purposely omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without sin. As assembling of the Church, Prayer, Fasting, giving a particular charge to the Person ordained to be Faithfull, and Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands whiles the charge is given. All which Circumstances of Ordination, may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of these Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 12, 13.
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:30732:266"/>
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 3. compared with, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27. 18, 19, 22, 23.</p>
                        <p>Obj. <hi>But Ordination is but an Action of men, and the Call of God is enough without it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Though Ordination be the action of men, yet it is the Ordinance of God; 'Tis an Ordinance of his holy Spirit. Even as baptism is the action of men, but the Ordinance of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 25. 'Twas <hi>Johns</hi> action to baptise, yet it was Gods Ordinance, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2. <hi>[The Holy Ghost said, seperate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul <hi>to the work.]</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>[The Holy Ghost hath made you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseers.]</hi> that is, Elders of the Church, <hi>v.</hi> 17. and all Church-Elders were ordained by men, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23.</p>
                        <p>So that this Ordination, is the Call of God by men; a mediate call: God doth Call us by his Messengers and Embassadors, doth send them to call us in his name, to be Ministers.</p>
                        <p>2. There hath been an immediate Call to Saint-ship formerly. As <hi>Paul</hi> was called by a voice from Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. yet that is not the way of God now: but he calls his Saints ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily by an outward Calling, and a mediate Call, by men. As the immediate Call to Christianity is ceased: so also is the immediate Call to the Ministry ceased, and the mediate Call even Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation placed in the room of it, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                        <p>3. The richest Treasures of the Gospel are conveyed to the Church by men: all Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Dispensations are by men, as well as Ordination. Is not preaching by men? are they not men that baptise and give the Lords Supper? is not the making of Disciples, and the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:30732:266"/> perfecting of the Saints done by man? did not Christ say to men, Go ye, Disciple the Nations, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28? Yea did not God redeem the world by man? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21. <hi>[for since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.]</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>[God was manifest in the flesh.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Shall we despise All these things, because they are done by man! Then let us not despise ordination neither, because it is done by men: but remember, they are men of God, Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors of God, that do it; and 'tis done by special appointment of God: He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not men but God.</p>
                        <p>Ob. <hi>But</hi> Paul <hi>preached some time before his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, compare</hi> Acts 9. 20. <hi>with chapt.</hi> 13. <hi>where we read of his ordination afterward,</hi> ergo <hi>men may preach un-ordained.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Though <hi>Paul</hi> had not his ordinary Call before he preached, yet He had an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Call before; which was to him instead of ordination. For He preached not before a voice from Heaven had told him that <hi>Ananias</hi> should give him his Errand and Commission from God, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 10, 12, 13, 14, 15. Yea He was told from Heaven that he must be a Minister, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 16, 17.</p>
                        <p>2. To what purpose was he afterwards or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, but because the Holy Ghost saw an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency in his preaching without ordination, though he had an extraordinary Call before? <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2, 3. <hi>[Seperate them, I have called them.]</hi> q. d. <q>'Tis true, <hi>Paul</hi> hath Preached hitherto without Solemn ordination, I gave him an

                        <p>This Proving is the beginning of Ordination, and after some examination, 'tis generally held lawfull, for those that have been examined to preach before the Ordainers; that they may have a Taste of their Gift in utterance before they Ordain them: Yet this Preaching is not to be undertaken of a mans own head; but by the appointment of the Ordainers, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to an intended Ordination.</p>
                        <p>This Probation which <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> is in order to Ordination, and therefore when <hi>Titus</hi> is bid to ordain, he is minded of the Qualifications of those whom he should ordain; which shews he had power to prove them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had such Gifts or not? <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 9. And so when <hi>Paul</hi> speaks to <hi>Timothy</hi> of proving such as desire the Office, he sets down the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of a Minister, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. Therefore I said, that Proving is the beginning of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:30732:267"/> because 'tis in order to Ordination, and is the root and cause of Sending: for therefore men are ordained, because they are fit for it, and are found qualified for such an employment.</p>
                        <p>We conclude then, when the Apostle saith, <hi>[Let them first be proved]</hi> he meaneth, Let them first be proved in order to ordination, and with intention to ordain them; and afterwards let them use the Office. See another place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. How can they preach except they be sent? that is, except they be ordained. For Christ sent forth the Twelve, saying, Go preach, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7. and this Sending was an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                        <p>And this strict rule being set by <hi>Paul</hi> himself, who preached so long without ordination, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to stop the mouth of a Gain-sayer for ever; and may take away all pretences to his example and authority, as any warrant, to uphold irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar preaching before ordination.</p>
                        <p>For He himself that preached before ordination left this rule in the Church under his own hand, that men should be first ordained before they use the office of a Minister.</p>
                        <p>Yea <hi>Paul</hi> himself who preached (by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Call) before ordination, was the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Ordainer, and the Greatest Promoter of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that we find recorded in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Though <hi>Paul</hi> preached freely at <hi>Corinth</hi> without taking wages of them, yet who hath written more in defence of Ministers maintenance than <hi>Paul?</hi> Even so, though <hi>Paul</hi> preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordination, yet who hath done more, or written more in defence of Ordination, than He?
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:30732:268"/> It was <hi>Paul</hi> that joyned with <hi>Barnabas</hi> to ordain Elders in every Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. It was <hi>Paul</hi> that joyn'd with the Presbytery or Eldership to ordain <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. It was <hi>Paul</hi> that Gave the Rules for Ordination in his Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and gave them charge from God to ordain others, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. &amp; <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                        <p>All this shews, that <hi>Paul</hi> was of this opinion, that though he had an extraordinary Call by a voyce from Heaven, to preach before Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet Those that have no such voice from Heaven to Call them, should not preach, as he had done, before Ordination; and without an outward Sending, by men disputed of God, to stand in his stead to send them of Gods errand, and about Gods work.</p>

                        <p>All these Liberties belong to Private Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: yea not only to men, but to women also in some cases, as is proved by the examples of <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba, Lois, Eunice, Abigail, Hester, Lydia, Priscil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and other good women mentioned in the Bible.</p>
                        <p>And therefore All this that a Gifted man may do amounts not to preaching; for 'tis no more than what a Gifted woman may do, either widow, or maried wife with her Husbands leave. Yet what sober mind will grant a woman liberty to preach?</p>
                        <p>Now let me shew you what a Gifted man may not do, except he be a Minister; which is the second Thing.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Bound</hi> 1.</p>
                        <p>1. The Gifted man is limited and bounded in his Family. For though he may teach his children and servants, and pray with them, yet he may not administer the Sacraments to them: for God hath appointed his Ministers to be his Seal-Keepers, as is before-shewed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
                        <p>The Gifted man may catechise them and fit them for Sacraments, and there his work ends, and there the Ministers work begins.</p>
                        <p>The Houshold of <hi>Stephanus</hi> was baptised, yet not by <hi>Stephanus</hi> himself, but by <hi>Paul,</hi> 1

                        <p>2. The Gifted man is bounded and limited in teaching: limited to his family and his own Houshold: for though he may teach (them,) yet he may not teach the (Church) or whole House of God, without ordination, <hi>John</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3. He must not climbe into the sheepfold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Porter openeth to him; and then the sheep hear his voyce, that is, the sheep hear him preach in the Fold, or Solemn Assembly. This teaching of the Church belongs to Ministers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. to an ordained <hi>Timothy,</hi> and such as He was, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. compared with chap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

To what purpose should Christ chuse Embassadors to do that, which belongs to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man? and I have before shewed, that Preaching the word, is the Principal work of a Minister.</p>
                        <p>Hence Prophesying in the Church is limited to Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 29. <hi>[Let the Prophets speak, &amp;c.]</hi> when shall they speak? see <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>[when the whole Church be come together in some place.]</hi> chapt. 12. 29. <hi>[Are all Prophets? are all Teachers?]</hi> Hence Pastors and Teachers (men in office) are said to be given on purpose for the edifying of the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
                        <p>God hath his Embssassadors for the Church, as well as for the world: and none must carry
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:30732:270"/> his errand to the Church: but one that hath special Commission. The Apostle tells the Church He was an Embassador for Christ to them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech them, as though God besought them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                        <p>The Gifted man may teach his Family; and there his work ends; his Teaching-work, his Teaching-exercise is bounded within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of his own Family; and here the Ministers work begins: The Minister teacheth a Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Congregation of Families, teacheth the whole Church. For what is a Church (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           <hi>Bound</hi> 3.</p>
                        <p>3. The Gifted man is limited in conference and discourse. 'Tis true he may confer and discourse of Divine matters, but not in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all times. He is limited to private Houses, and private Places, for his discourse; He may not confer with a Minister (much lesse dispute with him and controul him) in the Church, and the solemn Assemblies for worship of God. Thus the malicious <hi>Jews</hi> did disturb Christ frequently in publick; but his own Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples put their Questions privately, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 3. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 28. <hi>[When he was come into the House, his Disciples asked him privately.]</hi> So those Religious Proselytes followed <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> when the Congregation was broken up, to confer with
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:30732:270"/> them, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 43. and thus <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> discoursed privately with <hi>Apollos</hi> about the way of God, and of Christs baptism, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 26.</p>
                        <p>Indeed a private Christian may discourse of Religion before a civil Court of Judicature, when he is called to it by the Magistrate, and falsely accused. As <hi>Stephen,</hi> and the blessed Martyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> times, disputed with the Bishops for the truth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16. But this is rather a Just Defence, than a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or voluntary conference. This is an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for a mans self against the mouth of Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers.</p>
                        <p>But a Minister may (if occasion be offered) discourse Publickly with another Minister: yea He may dispute openly with any Enemy, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 32. <hi>[The Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets.]</hi> Gal. 2. 5, 6, 14. <hi>[They who seemed to be somewhat in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence added nothing to me. I said unto</hi> Peter <hi>before them all, &amp;c.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here one Minister had open conference with another before the People, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>[I am fit for the defence of the Gospel.]</hi> See further, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                        <p>A private Christian may confer in private Assemblies; and there his conference-work ends: and here the Ministers work begins: who is (by office) to confer in publick upon necessary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions. As Christ often reasoned with the Scribes and Pharisees openly, who sate in <hi>Moses</hi> Chair, and were men in office.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bound</hi> 4.</p>
                        <p>4. The Gifted man (if un-ordained) is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:30732:271"/> in Private Meetings. 'Tis true, Private Christians may meet together; they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and pray and read together, upon divers occasions. But they may not preach, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Meeting: They may not expound and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Scripture, in private Meetings: They may not take a Text, raise Doctrins, Reasons, Uses, and deliver Sermons as from themselves, in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Meetings: They may not do that to a combination of Families in an House, which none but Ministers may do in the Church.</p>
                        <p>I say, The Private Christian is limited to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, in such Meetings: this is the Bound which God hath set him, and he must not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it. His highest Privilege is Conference, or speaking one to another, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>[Spake of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten one to another:)</hi> not one to all, not one to many; but one to one, one to another; in famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar conference, or communication; as the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that went to <hi>Emmaus, Luke</hi> 24. 17. <hi>[One to another.]</hi> So <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> to one <hi>Apollos,</hi> Acts 18. So Christs Disciples spake to him one by one in their private Assemblies, <hi>John</hi> 14. 5, 8. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 19. <hi>[And to say unto him, One by one.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus far Christ allowed Women, even <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> to confer with him in points of Faith, <hi>John</hi> 11. 20, 21, 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this was the highest Privilege that <hi>Cornelius</hi> had in that private Meeting, though in his own house: He had a familiar discourse with <hi>Peter,</hi> one to one, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 29, 30, 31, &amp;c. but <hi>Peter</hi> only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted the Scripture, as may be seen in the same chapter.</p>
                        <p>Here's the difference betwixt Preaching and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:30732:271"/> Conference. Conference is a mutual speaking by course one to one: Preaching is a single speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one to many; and that in a way of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or exposition of the Scripture.</p>
                        <p>When only two Disciples and Christ were met together in a journey: the two Disciples com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned one with another, and both of them with Christ, by turns; I mean, one at a time: But Christ only expounded the Scriptures, and made a continued Speech, in that short meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And after Christ was come among them, they did not offer to speak in his presence, till they were asked a question, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 13, 14, &amp;c. <hi>&amp; v.</hi> 25, 26, 27.</p>
                        <p>And that you may thorowly understand, this matter I will reduce it to a particular Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
                        <p>Quest. <hi>Whether may a Private Christian (if a Gifted man) expound the Scripture, at a private Meeting, either in his own or any other House, where several Persons are met together; out of several Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies or Housholds, to serve God in private Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> No, He may not: 'Tis unlawfull in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cases, and especially where there is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to be had, so to do.</p>
                        <p>I grant, A Gifted man may teach his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, in the hearing of any Friends and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that may come occasionally to him upon some special business, whiles he is in the duty. If any come in accidentally (whiles a man is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the Scripture to his house) he doth not properly expound to them: but only to his own family in their hearing. As one that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisheth
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:30732:272"/> a Brother before Witnesses, doth not properly admonish the Witnesses, but his Brother in their hearing: As I may catechize my Child before a whole house full of people; and yet my so doing is not at all a catechising of the Standers by. All this is granted.</p>
                        <p>Yet a Private Christian ought not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Scripture, in any set appointed meeting, to the Members of several families, purposely and Customarily assembled, to serve God together in one house.</p>
                        <p>Ground.</p>
                        <p>1. Because to expound Scripture to any set assembly greater than thy own houshold, is to preach: and preaching in a house is all one as preaching in a Pulpit. <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 30, 31. Here <hi>Pauls</hi> teaching the things of Christ at a set meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his own house, is called preaching, and this work of private teaching belongs to the Ministry, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 20, 21. <hi>[I have taught you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and from house to house, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.]</hi> and and thus <hi>Peter</hi> preached in <hi>Cornelius</hi> his house, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 36, 42. Preaching is preaching where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be; and that which is preaching in a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, is so in an house too. And I have already proved that none must preach but Ministers. And what is Preaching, but an Interpretation of the Scriptures to a combination of Families, or to a congregation of Church-Members and others, met together for Solemn worship? Hence 'tis called, A right dividing the word of Truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. A giving the sence of Scripture, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 7, 8.</p>
                        <pb n="387" facs="tcp:30732:272"/>
                        <p> 2. Because in those Private meetings which are recorded in Scripture, there were Ministers appointed to meet among them, and they only expounded the Scriptures at such Meetings. For instance, That meeting which <hi>Malachy</hi> speaks of, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. it cannot be thought that the Prophet excludes himself, when he sayes, They that feared the Lord spake often one to another, &amp;c. and that famous meeting in <hi>Cornelius</hi> house was a meeting of several persons, out of more Housholds than one; and <hi>Peter</hi> was the only Teacher among them, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 24, 27, 33, 34. And <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were the only Teachers in that Private meeting, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 43. And <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were the only Teachers in that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (whether publick or private,) <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 13. 'Tis very likely this was a publick meeting, free or all comers.</p>
                        <p>So in All the Private meetings which Christ held with his Disciples, he himself was the only Teacher among them, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 33, 34, 35, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other places.</p>
                        <p>And though <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> are said to expound the way of God to <hi>Apollos,</hi> Acts 18. yet they expounded not the Scripture to him, but the way of Christs baptism, different from <hi>John Baptists</hi> way. For <hi>Apollos</hi> was mighty in the Scriptures before, and was able rather to have helped them to expound the Scriptures, <hi>v.</hi> 24. How could he be mighty in the Scriptures, if he knew not the sence, if he could not expound till he were taught? but <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> gave him a relation of passages concerning the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and the Gift of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:30732:273"/> which he knew not of, before they told him; for he knew only the baptism of <hi>John,</hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. 25. Besides this expounding was to one <hi>Apollos,</hi> only to one man, <hi>v.</hi> 26. that is, by a familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or talking together, they acquainted him with many passages of Christ, and of the Apostles, and of the Holy Ghost, which came to pass betwixt <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism and that time; such as <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4, 5. and chapter 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages which were not written in the Scripture: for in <hi>Apollos</hi> time, the New Testament was not written; and now there were no other Scriptures than the Old Testament. And further, this meeting of <hi>Apollos</hi> with <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> was no set-meeting on purpose, or custom, but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional, and unthought of: for he was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Synagogue, and they heard him, and so they took occasion to speak privately with him, <hi>v.</hi> 26. therefore this example meddles not with the question, and is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                        <p>3. Because it is a superstitious Action, more than is written, a will-worship. The Scripture saith nothing of a private mans interpreting the Scripture in a private meeting. There is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Precept nor Example for it in the word of God. And if the Scripture saith nothing of it, we cannot practise it in faith, except we will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God after the traditions of men. And this Argument is much like that of the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 13, 14. <hi>[Of which Tribe</hi> Moses <hi>spake nothing concerning Priesthood.]</hi> So say I, The Scripture speaks of Ministers interpreting in private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But it speaks nothing of Gifted mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:30732:273"/> in such meetings. There is no Text which either expresseth or implyeth such a Liberty of interpretation. Because otherwise there would be no clear and sufficient distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt a Ministers work, and the work of a private person. For what is their Greatest work, but to Teach the Church? And what are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters but Church-Teachers? <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12. <hi>[Some Pastors and Teachers, for the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.]</hi> Teaching is the Ministers work, yea teaching in houses, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 20, 21.</p>
                        <p>A Minister is distinguished from all other men by his Teaching in the Church: Now if others should be allowed to preach, there would be little or no difference betwixt a Minister and no Minister. This were the way to make every man a Minister, and every Minister but a common man; and so by degrees this Office would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and the distinction cease.</p>
                        <p>But God will have this distinction of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to stand, their name shall be Teachers, and all shall not have that name in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28, 29. <hi>[God hath set some in the Church, some Teachers: are all Teachers?]</hi> and in other places 'tis said, Let every m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> abide in his own Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Let no man suffer as a busie Body in other mens matters.</p>
                        <p>5. Because (as I said) the Highest Privilege of a private Christian in a Set-meeting is Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or speaking one to another, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The Scripture saith they may confer together: and goes no further: therefore they must not pass this bound.</p>
                        <p>Ob. <hi>But why may not a man teach many at once,</hi>
                           <pb n="390" facs="tcp:30732:274"/>
                           <hi>as well as one? why not teach in a private Meeting, as well as in our own Families?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> Because thou hast a Call to do the one, but no Call to do the other: thou art Called to teach in thy Family; but not in other mens Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, nor in a Set-meeting.</p>
                        <p>Why might not Gifted <hi>Saul,</hi> and Gifted <hi>Ʋz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> as well offer Sacrifice and Incense, as pray in their Families? Because they had no Call to it.</p>
                        <p>2. Because thou art Master and Ruler in thy own Family: but thou art no Master nor Ruler over other mens Families. And Teaching is an act of Superiority and Authority; and to be Taught, is an act of Subjection, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11, 12. chapt. 4. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7.</p>
                        <p>To these may be added all the grounds before urged in my Answer to the Question.</p>
                        <p>We conclude then, that God hath set Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gifted men their Bounds, which they must not pass: and this is one Bound which is set them: They are limited in Private Meetings: They are limited to Conference: And they must not preach in Private Houses.</p>
                        <p>And believe it, 'tis dangerous breaking out beyond the bounds which God hath set, lest we fall into a <hi>Perez-Ʋzzah,</hi> or lest we perish in the Gain-saying of <hi>Corah,</hi> and lest the Lord break forth upon us, as the Scripture phrase is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the old bounds which once God set to <hi>Israel,</hi> Exod. 19. 21, 22, 23, 24. with <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>[Thou shalt set bounds unto the people, &amp;c. Charge the people lest they break thorow to gaze, and many of them perish: Let not the Priests and the people break</hi>
                           <pb n="391" facs="tcp:30732:274"/>
                           <hi>thorow, to come up to the Lord, lest he break forth upon them.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus much of the Bounds betwixt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and the Gifted man.</p>

                        <p>I will put a plain case, Suppose a Stranger should come into the Pulpit, and preach a good Sermon, and you would know, whether this man be a Minister, or only a Gifted man; go to the Minister that admitted him into the Pulpit, and ask him, whether He that Preached be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, or not; if He cannot tell, go to the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher and ask him, what Ministers he is acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with; if he be acquainted with no Ministers, it's an hundred to one, but he is an un ordained man: if he be, go to those Ministers and ask them.</p>

                        <p>The Testimony of a good Minister (especially i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> an eye-witness of any mans ordination) deserve credit, and is a sufficient ground, <hi>Lu.</hi> 1. 1, 2. <hi>[Things which are most surely believed among us, even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and Ministers of the Word.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence it was a Custom formerly in <hi>England,</hi> if any man came to be Minister of any Parish, Two or Three Neighbouring Ministers were to give him possession of the Church, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And this action of known Ministers was that which deservedly satisfied the People.</p>
                        <p>But now the Times are so loose in Liberty, that 'tis harder to discern a mans ordination, than it hath been: and therefore if you find it not out by report of other, take another course, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. By some Instrument, Writing, Commission or Certificate. How will you certainly know a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of Peace, but by a sight of his Commission. How will you certainly know a Husband and Wife, from a Fornicator and his Whore, but by a Certificate of timely Mariage?</p>
                        <p>Even so you may know a Minister from another man, and from an Usurper, by his Certificate of Ordination under the hands of those that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him.</p>
                        <p>Thus Saint <hi>Luke</hi> certifies in writing, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ordained, in his Treatise of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> Acts 13. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:30732:275"/> of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that <hi>Timothy</hi> was ordained by himself and the Presbytery, in his Epistles to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> which were to be published to the whole Church.</p>
                        <p>Yea thus <hi>Paul</hi> certified of <hi>Titus,</hi> when he was to go to <hi>Corinth</hi> where he was unknown, that he was his Partner in the Ministry, and sends this Certificate in an Epistle to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to satisfie all that should enquire of him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23. <hi>[Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any do enquire of</hi> Titus, <hi>He is my Partner and Fellow-helper.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then, If a Stranger preach among you, and you would know whether he be a Minister: Go to him, and modestly enquire of him whether He be ordained? If he answers, yea: then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire further, where, and by whom? and desire him to direct you to some Ministers of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance that may inform you of his Office: or else intreat him to bring his Certificate of Ordination with him when he comes next to preach, and to shew it you in the presence of some faithfull Minister of the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>Here I will answer an Objection.</p>
                        <p>Ob. <hi>But</hi> Paul <hi>proves his Office another way,</hi> viz. <hi>by successe of his labours, and saith, He needed not Certificates of men,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 1, 2. with 2 Cor. 3. 1, 2, 3. <hi>[or need we, as some others, Epistles of Commendation to you.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> Successe doth not alwaies prove a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Call. Stollen corn may grow; and a Child begotten in Adultery may thrive. And Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:30732:276"/> his Church: For all things shall work together for good: yea God may make good use of the Ministry of the Devil himself, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 16, 17.</p>
                        <p>2. Set the ill success of Gifted men against their good successe: and 'twill be like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Kine, the bad will devour and eat up all the good. Many Gifted men have had but bad success by their irregular preaching, both for themselves and their Hearers. Such hath been the blindness of mind, hardness and pride of heart, strong Delusion and Apostacy which hath possessed some of them, that they may serve as Monuments of wrath, and Spectacles of Gods vengeance to After-ages. And whence have come our Divisions, Seperations, Errors, Heresies, Blasphemies; but from the Toleration of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and Un-ordained Preachers?</p>
                        <p>Yet my opinion is of those Learned and Good Ministers who are made Tryers of Preachers, that if the Supreme Magistrate would grant them a Commission to ordain all those whom they find un-ordained; they would then more than try; they would also ordain them, or else refer them to be ordained, before they admit or approve of them.</p>
                        <p>But to return to my purpose, let me speak something to the Text in the Objection.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Paul</hi> was an ordained Minister, and known at <hi>Corinth:</hi> and his drift (in the Texts urged) is to prove, that He was not only ordained of men; but also fitted and qualified of God, and that sufficiently: and that this was his aim (in pleading Success) appears in the same Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5, 6. <hi>[Who also hath made us able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters]</hi>
                           <pb n="395" facs="tcp:30732:276"/> And some at <hi>Corinth</hi> had cavilled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Abilities, undervalued his Gifts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 10. Now (saith <hi>Paul)</hi> to prove my Gifts, I need not bring you a Certificate from others, for you have had ample experience of them; and consequently I am no Titular Minister only; but a real Minister; both Gifted and Called. This is the scope.</p>
                        <p>4. Though <hi>Paul</hi> needed not Letters Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial after his Ordination and Gifts were known at <hi>Corinth;</hi> yet at other places he needed such Letters, before he was ordained and before he was known</p>
                        <p>Time was when <hi>Paul</hi> needed a good Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, <hi>viz.</hi> when he began first to preach, when he was not known to be a Minister, and before the Church was acquainted, that God had given him a Call from Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 26, 27, 28. <hi>[Barnabas took him, and brought him to the Apostles, and declared unto them, how He had seen the Lord in the way, and that He had spoken to him, &amp;c.] Paul</hi> doth not undertake to satisfie the People by his Gifts concerning his Call: but refers all to the Testimony of <hi>Barnabas</hi> his Fellow-Minister; and he satisfies all the other Apostles concerning <hi>Paul;</hi> and then the Church joyn themselves to him, not before. And he was with them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in and going out, at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that is as a Guide, or Minister.</p>
                        <p>But after this <hi>Paul</hi> was ordained (as I said) and became a famous Minister; and was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly known at <hi>Corinth,</hi> as their Minister; and now he needed not these kind of Testimonials, as formerly.</p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:30732:277"/>
                        <p> The Case of many of our Antient Ministers in <hi>England.</hi> How ridiculous would it be for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters that have lived many years with a People, to bring Testimonials to their own Flock? The Peoples own experience is the best Testimonial in such a case: written not with ink and paper, but with the Spirit of the living God.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Paul</hi> confesseth that other Ministers do need Testimonials, though He did not, for the phrase is <hi>[Need we, as Some other, Epistles of Commendation,]</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1. Yea <hi>Paul</hi> gives such Letterr in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of others that were not known, and some that were partly known before. As to <hi>Titus,</hi> and the Messengers sent with him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 18, 22, 23. So also He gives like Letters of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in behalf of <hi>Timothy,</hi> Phil. 2. 22. <hi>[As a Son with the Father, He hath served with me in the Gospell.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We conclude then, that the Office of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is to be known ordinarily by Certificates of Ordination. And Ordinary Ministers need such Certificate in strange places; though <hi>Paul</hi> (who was well known, and was able, if need had been, to have wrought a Miracle to prove his Call to the Ministry) might not need it, as others do.</p>
                        <p>Thus much of sixth Question. Let me briefly apply the Doctrine.</p>

                        <p>This Doctrin may teach us to see what an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror it is to deny the Office of the Ministery. For if the Office be a Fundamental Truth, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal of it can be no less than a Fundamental er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, an error that razeth the Foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:30732:277"/> a damnable Heresie, a denyal of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, as appears by these three Scriptures urged in the beginning, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 14, 15. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 16. <hi>John</hi> 13. 20.</p>
                        <p>Aggravations of this Error.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It destroys the Principal means of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith; for so is the Ministry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10, 14, 15, 17.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It destroys the greatest Bulwark of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, the greatest Preservative against Apostacy; such is the Ministry. For God gives Pastors and Teachers to keep men from being tossed to and fro with every wind of Doctrin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 14. and they are set for defence of the Gospel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It overthrows all publick Ordinances, and consequently all publick Sabbaths, and all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Assemblies for Divine worship.

                        <p>This may teach us to magnifie this Office of the Ministry, and to prize it, and be thankfull for it! Christians, Do not you undervalue that for which Christ dyed, and rose again. Do not you put your feet upon it: But rather exalt it, rather crown it with a Crown of Glory, rather give your hearts, and hands, and heads, and tongues, in defence of it; rather give up your Souls and selves to it, rather bestow your best Affections &amp; dearest Loves upon it. Remember 'tis expresly signed with the reverend Name of the blessed Trinity, as I shewed you in the beginning. There
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:30732:278"/> are three eminent Scriptures which magnifie this Office, as the mouth of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. 9, 10, 11. but I hasten.</p>

                        <p>This may teach us to reverence the Persons that bear this Office. Honour Ministers for their Office-sake. Do not despise them in your Hearts; Do not revile them with your Tongues; Do not disgrace them with your evil Lives; Do not kill them with Unkindnesses; Do not joyn in conspiracy against them; Do not rob them of their Dues; Do not starve their Bodies, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do their Families: Do not vex their righteous Souls by filthy conversations.

(Work's sake.) what is their work? an excellent, Heavenly, honourable, comfortable, profitable work. For what do they do for you?

                        <p>The Apostle unites the Office and work so inseperably, that to desire the one is to desire the other, and to undertake the one, is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the other, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>[If any man desire the Office, He desires the work.]</hi> q. d.

                        <p>This may teach us to improve the Office of the Ministry. Make good use of Ministers whiles you have them. Obey them; be ruled by them; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise with them, ask their Help and Direction, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p n="4">4. Use them as your Comforters: In case you be troubled in mind, go to your Minister for satisfaction; say to them as the Converts did to the Apostles, and as the Goaler, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>Acts</hi> 16. <hi>What must I do to be saved?</hi>

                        <p>This error against the resurrection, was rife among the Jewes, a little before their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, maintained by the Sect of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. v. 27. <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 8.</p>
                        <p>And indeed there is no great difference in religion betwixt those old Sadduces, and our new Sadduces the Quakers: as may appear by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> comparison of their principles.</p>
                        <p>The Comparison; or the common principles of Sadduces, old and new.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The old Sadduces rejected most part of the Scripture, even all but the five books of <hi>Moses:</hi> and therefore Christ urgeth against them <hi>Moses</hi> writings, though in other books of the old Testament, there were plainer proofs of the resurrection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.</p>
                        <p>And do not our new Sadduces deny all Scripture: but what they judge to suit best with their pretended light within them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The old Sadduces, were great Sectaries, separated themselves from the other Jewes: They are called, the Sect of the Sadduces, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
                        <p>So do our new Sadduces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3▪ The old Sadduces could not endure the Apostles and Ministers of Christ, but hated them, and joyned with their persecutors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:30732:283"/> them, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 17. 18.</p>
                        <p>So our new Sadduces hate Ministers, and were it in their power, we should feel more of their fury.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The old Sadduces denied the reward of good works, and the punishment of evil works, in the world to come. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth against them, the hope of the dead, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 6. Intimating their denial of all hope and reward in another life.</p>
                        <p>And some of our new Sadduces deny Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell, and deride the place of the blessed, the Heaven of Heavens: as I have heard them before many witnesses.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The old Sadduces denied the resurrection of the body, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 8.</p>
                        <p>So many of our new Sadduces, are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled against the resurrection of the body: whereof I have been also an Ear-witness.</p>
                        <p>Thus you have the Correspondency of the Sadduces and Quakers in their Principles, which shewes, they both walked by the same light; And the Principles of both are from the same Author, <hi>viz.</hi> The Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

                        <p> Here I will give you warning of three great Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors against the Resurrection; and will first set down the Errors, and then the Confutation.</p>
                        <p>Error I. <hi>That there is no other Resurrection but that which is Spiritual, or that of the Soul from the death of Sin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Confutation.</p>
                        <p>1. This was the very Error of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> who said, The Resurrection was past; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17, 18. They seemed to grant a Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which is past in this life, denying that to come.</p>
                        <p>All Heretiques (to colour their Heresies) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to hold in some sence or other, what they intend to destroy; I will give some Instances.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Christs Adversaries were for (a) Christ, but not for (the) Christ.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The false Teachers at <hi>Galatia</hi> were for (a) Gospel; but not for (the) Gospel. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Papists are for (a) Justification, but not for (the) Justification.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Enemies of <hi>Pauls</hi> Ministry, were for (a) Ministry (like <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company who sought the Priesthood also) but not for (the) Ministry, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The Adversaries of the Sabbath are for (a) Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, but not for (the) Sabbath, not for the Lords day, but pretend every day for a Sabbath.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The Adversaries of the Scripture are for (a) Scripture, and for (a) word of God: but not for (the) Scripture, not for (the) written word of God.</p>
                        <p>In like manner: The Adversaries of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, are for (a) Resurrection, but not for
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:30732:284"/> (the) Resurrection; not for the last, and great, and Universal Resurrection at the last day. <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meneus</hi> and <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>tus</hi> were for a Resurrection which was past, but not for that to come.</p>
                        <p>2. The Scripture makes a plain distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Spiritual and Corporal Resurrection, and maintaineth both. Compare <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 24, 25. with <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. The Spiritual Resurrection is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to believers, <hi>v.</hi> 24. But the Corporal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection is extended to all that are in the Graves; and 'tis said, they shall come forth, some to Life, and some to Damnation, which cannot be meant of the Spiritual Resurrection, <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. Yea the Scripture speaks of the rising again of those that were spiritually risen before, and of their rising, again after they are Dead in the Lord, after they are fallen asleep in Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Yea Christ speaks of raising the Spiritual Believer in the last day, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 40.</p>
                        <p>3. The Scripture speaks of a first Resurrection, and a second Death. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 5, 6. I will open this Text in another place.</p>
                        <p>Now as the Second Death implyeth and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a first <hi>(viz.</hi> a Natural Death, besides the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al:) So the first Resurrection implyeth and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth a second Resurrection, <hi>viz.</hi> a Natural or Corporal Resurrection besides the Spiritual: for how can there be a first, without a second, or a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, without a first?</p>
                        <p>4. Our Resurrection shall be the same with Christs Resurrection; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12, 13, 20, 21. <hi>Isay</hi> 26. 19. <hi>Together with my Dead Body shall they arise.</hi> 1 Thes. 4. 14. <hi>Even so, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now Christs Resurrection could not be Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:30732:284"/> a Resurrection of his Soul from Sin, for he was no Sinner, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
                        <p>But his Resurrection was Corporal; He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Soul at last gasp to his Father, and his Body was laid in the Grave, and the same Body rose again. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 6, 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 37, 38, 39.</p>
                        <p>And how shall our Bodies be like his Glorious Body, except they be raised again, as his was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Error II. That in the Resurrection, the Substance of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes shall be changed, and so not the same Bodies Rise, but some other new created Bodies; new, Airy Bodyes, not flesh and Blood, Bones and Sinews,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Confutation.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This opinion destroys the Resurrection, and turns it into a Creation; for if the Bodyes be new made, and not the same Substance, then there is no Resurrection of the old, but a making of new; but there will be a real Resurrection, and we read of a Resurrection at the last day in many places: but of no new Creation, then, of no new Bodies, and new Substances; but of a rising again, in many places of the Bible before urged. Creation is out of nothing; Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of things in being, before a rising again of the same thing that had fallen.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Bodyes that shall arise shall come forth of the Graves, therefore they will be the same Bodyes that lay in the Graves and rotted there, and no other; <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 28, 29. <hi>All that are in the Graves shall come forth; Mat.</hi> 27. 52, 53. And the Sea shall render up the Dead, not new Bodyes, but the old Dead Bodyes; <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 13.</p>

                           <pb n="412" facs="tcp:30732:285"/> 3. The Bodyes of the Faithful are the very Members of Christ: and is it likely that Christ will lose one of them? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. <hi>Know you not that your Bodyes are the Members of Christ?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now if the same Bodyes rise not, Christs Members perish, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 18. <hi>Then they also which are fallen a sleep in Christ are perished.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Christ is speaking that he will lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all which the Father hath given him, he adds, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 39, 40. <hi>I will raise it up again at the last day;</hi> implying, that what is not raised, is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly lost.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Bodyes of the wicked shall be cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell; therefore the same Bodyes shall rise, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 29, 30.</p>
                        <p>Now if God should raise up new Bodyes, and punish them that had never Sinned, this were great injustice: to punish one Body for another, to punish a Sin-lesse Body new Created, for a Sinful Body formerly made, and degenerated from its first Creation.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The Bodyes that shall rise, shall be our own Bodies, and the same Bodyes that are now our own in this life, shall be our own in the last day; therefore not new Bodyes, not strange Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes. <hi>Job</hi> saith, he shall see his Redeemer with his own eyes, and not another, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 27.

                        <p>Therefore when the Apostle speaketh of the Resurrection of the Body, he doth as it were point with the finger to these our own Bodyes, and saith, <hi>this Mortal, this Corruptable,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 53.

                        <p>3. When the Apostle comes to explain himself afterward, and to apply this Similitude, he says peremptorily; This Corruptible must put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, and this Mortal, Immortality, and urgeth it twice together in two verses, <hi>v.</hi> 53, 54.

'tis not with what Soul or Spirit; but with what Body? that's the state of the question.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>A Spiritual Body;</hi> that is not of a Spiritual Substance, as if the Body should be turned into a
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:30732:287"/> Soul, or Spirit, or Angel: But a Body endued with Spiritual qualities; free from Carnal desires, and wholly Subject to the Spirit.</p>
                        <p>The Glorified Saints will be like Angels for quality, in respect of the use and Exercise of the body after the resurrection; They shall have no inclinations to marriage and other earthly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 30.

                        <p>We read of spiritual men, spiritual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, spiritual minds, in the Scripture: yet by the word (spiritual) we do not mean a change of substance, but of qualities: neither men, nor their understandings, nor minds, are turned into Spirits, or spiritual substances: but only their qualities are become spiritual.</p>
                        <p>Even so, we read of a spiritual body in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, yet the meaning is not a spiritual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but a spiritual quality in the body raised, a spiritual disposition and inclination.</p>
                        <p>I have been so large in Confutation of this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that I will be brief in the next.</p>
                        <p>Error III. <hi>That the Soul is mortal, dyeth with the body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Confutation.</p>
                        <p>This error destroys the resurrection: for if the Soul dye, the body cannot be quickned, nor rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for the Soul is the life of the body: a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less body is a dead body; Therefore Christ urged the immortality of the souls of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> against the Sadduces, to prove the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surection
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:30732:287"/> of their bodies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 31, 32, <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,</hi> that is, of the living souls of <hi>Abraham, Isaac, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To extirpate this error, let me put together some principal Texts of Scripture, which prove the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of our Souls; and then collect some plain arguments out of them, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 8, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 22, 23, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21, 33, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3, 19, 20, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 7.</p>
                        <p>Arguments.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If the Soul out-lives the body, be alive after the body is dead, then it dies not with the body, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10 28, <hi>which kill the Body but are not able to kill the Soul.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Jews killed <hi>Stephens</hi> body But his Soul went up to Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 59. And see <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 31. 32.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If the Soul be present with the Lord after tis absent from the Body, then it dies not with the Body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Absent from the body, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with the Lord. Phil.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>To be dissolved and to be with Christ. Eccl.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>And the Spirit shall return to God who gave it.</hi> As the Spirit of Christ, and the Saint-Thief, returned to God.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If the Soul be perfect in the State of separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Body, then it dyeth not with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. 23. <hi>Made perfect.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. If death be gain to a Believer, then he doth not lose his Soul when he dies, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21, 23. <hi>To die is gain.</hi>

                        <p>Believe this Principle: mix it with Faith: Lay it up in your hearts: and believe and reckon upon it, that the dead shall rife.

                        </p>
                        <p>And that we may believe it let us consider our advantages which may exceedingly help our faith herein.</p>
                        <p>Advantages.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. We have Gods Decree for it, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, and his counsel shall stand; For God hath ordained a day of Judgment, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a resurrection day, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 42. And Christ inferres the resurrection from the judgment, or (which is all one,) the judgment from the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>John</hi> 5. 27, 28, 29. And Christ saith, 'tis his will, and his Fathers will, to raise the dead, <hi>John</hi> 6. 39, 40, <hi>And who can resist his will?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. We have Gods word for it, which is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but his word shall not fail. If God saith he will raise the dead, then he will do it; He abideth true and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny himself, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 18. And we have Gods
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:30732:288"/> word for it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 19. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 41. And all the Scriptures before urged.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We have the power of God engaged to effect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t; and that is omnipotent.</p>
                        <p>He that could create all things of nothing, what cannot he do? He can certainly raise the dead: He can distinguish the dust of mens bodies, from the dust of beasts, &amp; the dust of one mans body, from that of another, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 27. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20.</p>
                        <p>The Prophets and Apostles have raised the dead, How much more shall God, when he shall put forth all his power, and Almightinesse to effect it!</p>
                        <p>It was Gods power that supported <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith in this point, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 19.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. We have our own experience to suggest unto us the possibility and probability of the resurrection. Our experience in things natural and obvious, to sense. Our seed is sown, and dies, and yet rises again: Flies lie dead all the Winter long, yet revives again in Summer: The Herb is withered, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts and flourisheth again in spring: We sleep all the night, and awake in the morning: The day it self is buried every night, yet riseth again next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: yea, we see commonly how suddenly men fall into Swoons, and Trances, being for a time without breath, or shew of life, yet come again afterwards. All these things are as Emblems, Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and resemblances of the resurrection, which may convince us of the probability thereof: but Gods Decree, his Word, and Power, will put it past all doubt.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. We have the first fruits of the resurrection to help our faith. Christ is the first fruits, and so all those that rose at his resurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 20,

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> For these Reasons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because it is a prevailing motive to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: a Loud, and Shrill, and effectual Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:30732:291"/> to awake and to rouze men out of Carnal se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and presumption, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30, 31. <hi>All Men every where to repent: because he hath appointed a day wherein he will Judge the World.</hi> This Doctrine of the Judgement to come, made <hi>Felix</hi> tremble, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 25. Experience in our own Hearts shews it; Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> saith, if any thing in the World will move a man to fear the Lord, it is this; to remember the fearful and terrible day of Judgement.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Because the Knowledge of the Eternal Judgement is so strictly urged, as a matter of Life and Death; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 8. <hi>Knowing this first, that there shall come Scoffers, saying, where is the promise of his comming?</hi> and again, <hi>But be not ignorant of this,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>Hence it is so frequently taught in every Book almost of the New Testament.</p>

Because it hath been principally confessed and owned by blessed Martyrs and Christians in all ages; witnesse that passage in the old Creed, From whence he shall come to judge both the quick and the dead.

                        <p n="4">4. Because it is a comprehensive Doctrine: a Principle big with Principles; and hath many

                           <p>1. Against the Judgement it self: some say, there is no such thing as any Judgement to come after Death, that 'tis past already in this life; This is the Error of the wicked, a destroying Error.</p>
                           <p>Confutation.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. This is that very Error which St. <hi>Peter</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely Condemned many hundred years agoe; the Error of those Scoffers that shall come in the last dayes, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. The Scripture is plain and full for a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. The very Dead are the objects of Judgment: therefore death preceeds, and Judgment follows it: except in the case of those that shall be found alive at his comming, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 42. <hi>Judge of quick and dead.

                           <p>II. Against the Judge himself: Some Blasphemers say, that God is the Author of Sin, as much as of Grace: and so whatsoever men do, 'tis not they, but God in them: and Consequently, God is unrighteous if he condemn men for Sin, which is his own action, and motion in man. I have seen a printed book of this subject, full of Blasphemies.</p>
                           <p>Confutation.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. This Error (or rather Blasphemy) doth quite destroy the Doctrine of eternal Judgment: for if such Judgment be unrighteous, God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do it: and so there would be none at all, <hi>Ro.</hi>
                              <pb n="428" facs="tcp:30732:293"/> 3. 4. 5, 6. <hi>How then should God judge the world?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. This is the very same Error which St. <hi>James</hi> writeth against, and confuteth, <hi>James</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Let no man say, he is tempted of God,</hi> &amp;c. Though God doth permit sin, and decree the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of it: yet he decrees withal, that he will not be the Author, but will make every thing very good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 31.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. God is perfectly good: and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not concieve and bring forth evil, because he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably good, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Every good Tree bringeth forth good fruit.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. If God were the Author of sin; Why do the best and wisest men in all ages, blame themselves for sinful actions? (why do they not cast all the blame on God) As <hi>Job, David, Paul, Peter, Ps.</hi> 51. 4. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
                           <p>Yea the best men have alwayes reckoned sin to be against God, not for him: as if he were an Enemy, not an Author of it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>Sin against the Lord, Gen.</hi> 39. 9. <hi>And sin against God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. If God were an Author of sin, how comes it to pass that he so hates it, and punisheth it, and makes such strict Laws against it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 32. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 20. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. If God were Author of Sin, then Christ dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain: for then, eitheir sin is not sin, or else not ours, but Christs own: and so he dyed not for our sins, but for his own or nothing; But he had no sins of his own, and is therefore no Author of sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26, 27. <hi>Who needed not to offer up Sacrifice, first for his own sins,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 21. <hi>Who knew no sin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. To make God the Author of sin, is to make
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:30732:293"/> him not only a notorious sinner, but a notorious devil, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>The Divil sinneth from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>We conclude then that the Devil is the Author of sin, man a slave to sin, and God a rightious Iudge to punish men and Devils for sin. And though God be the just Author of the evil of punishment, yet he is not Author of the evil of sin: and though punishment, as 'tis a fruit of sin be evill, yet as it is Gods Act, it is an Act of impartial justice, and is therefore good as it comes from him, or as it is contrived by him, who is goodness it self, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righeousnesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p>III. Against the end of Judgment, <hi>viz.</hi> Reward and Punishment: Some affirm, there is no Heaven, nor Hell, no pain nor comfort after this life.</p>
                           <p>This destroys the Eternal Judgment: for to what end is Judgment, but to give to every one according to his works.</p>

                              <p>Grounds.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. The Scripture calls Christs coming to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his second appearance: reckoning his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (with all its Appurtenances) for the first appearance, and the day of judgement for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26, 27, 28. <hi>Once he appeared to put away sin, &amp;c. And as it is appointed to men once to die; but after this the judgement, so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; And to them that look for him, shall he appear the second time without sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to salvation.</hi> Here are two eminent appearances <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>

                              <p>Now it could not be the second (if another came between) but the third.</p>
                              <p>Therefore though an Angel from Heaven should tell me, Christs coming to judgement shall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>I know, there are many spiritual appearances of Christ recorded in Scripture, but of these the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks not in the Text urged, but of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal and bodily appearance.</p>
                              <p>And though Christ did personally appear se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times to his Disciples after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rection, yet all those particular appearances are put together, and comprised in one by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in this phrase, v. 6. <hi>Once hath he appeared to put away sin.</hi> That is, to take our flesh upon him, to dye for us, and to Conquer death by his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Resurrection, and so to ascend into Heaven, according to that great mystery of godliness, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 16.

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:30732:298"/> shall not bring from the dead all the Saints, but the Martyrs only and the rest shall rise afterwards. Therefore (in their own sense) all things will not be restored, nor all the Saints raised till the last day. And the Scripture tels us, the Heavens must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or contain him, till all things be restored. And this promise in the <hi>Acts,</hi> is general belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all penitent Sinners, not to the Martyrs only, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Repent, and be converted,</hi> and he shall send Jesus to refresh you at the times of restitution of all things, that is, the restitution of all penitent Sinners, of all Believers, whether they be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, or not Martyrs, the Promise is made to the penitent Sinner as such, and therefore the restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is extended to all Penitents.</p>
                              <p>And if Christ stay in Heaven till all the Saints be restored; then he will stay there till the general Resurrection, and consequently till Dooms-day: for the general Resurrection of the Saints will be at the end of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. 'Tis a received Maxime among Christians, that the Saints in all ages shall be sufferers in this worid; that is, at least, some in all ages, though some escape, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>All that Will live God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Christ Jeus, shall suffer Persecution;</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 22. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                              <p>If Sufferers, then not Reign with Christ on Earth, and see no sorrow, but have their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon Earth.</p>

                              <p n="3">3. It wrongeth the Souls of the dead Saints: to be put out of Heaven for a thousand years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; from the immediate enjoyment of God the Father, and God the holy Ghost and the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels, and from ten thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sands of other Saints which will be left behind in Heaven; This will be an injury and disadvantage to them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23, 24.</p>
                              <p n="4">4.

                              <p n="5">5. It makes a Schisme in Heaven; it separates the blessed Martyrs, from <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and those thousands of blessed Saints that dyed in the faith, and were not Martyrs; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now they are all together in one Church, and one general Assembly, they will be then broken into pieces, and divided each from other, as far as Earth is from Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 1.</p>

                              <p n="8">8. It interrupteth and breaketh off the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate intercession of Christ for the Saints on Earth: For how can He sit on the right hand of God in Heaven to appear in his presence on our behalf, when we shall have left Heaven for a thousand years together? <hi>Ro.</hi> 8. 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25, 26.</p>
                              <p n="9">9. It prejudiceth and wrongeth all those Saints on Earth, that shall be alive at Christs coming; all those Saints that shall be living at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the thousand years; for either they must live a thousand years with him on Earth; before they see Heaven; or else they must dye from him, not to him; go to Heaven, and misse of Christ when they come thither; they must depart hence, and
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:30732:299"/> leave Christ behind them, and so 'twill be worse with them, than it was with <hi>Paul</hi> and other Saints, who had the happinesse to be with Christ as soon as they were dissolved, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23.</p>

                              <p>Obj. <hi>But we read in the Revelations, that St.</hi> John <hi>by the Spirit of Prophesy, foresaw that the Martyrs should live and Reign with Christ a thousand years,</hi> Rev. 20. 4.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. 'Tis not said (on Earth:) that Christ should come down from Heaven and Reign on Earth, and the Martyrs Reign with him here: but only, they lived and Reigned with him a thousand years; and this Reign may be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not on Earth; <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4.</p>
                              <p>2. The whole verse speaks of Souls in the State of Seperation from the Body, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. <hi>I saw the Souls of them that are Beheaded for the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Jesus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and they Lived and Reigned with Christ a thousand years.</hi> 'Tis a Kingdom of Souls, not of Bodies; therefore a Spiritual, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, not a Worldly Kingdom: but the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb facs="tcp:30732:300"/> of Glory in Heaven; as <hi>Pareus</hi> observes; <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 28, 29, 30. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                              <p>3. If we should grant it to be on Earth, in the Peace and Prosperity of the Church on Earth; yet it would not follow, that Christ should Reign personally with them, or they with him; but Spiritually only: such a Spiritual Kingdom, as that; <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 21. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is within you.</hi>

                              <p>So the meaning would be this, <hi>The Souls of the Martyrs Lived and Reigned with Christ a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years;</hi> That is, such as they, Men of the same Souls and Spirits with the persecuted Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, shall live and boldly professe the same tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>2. The place speaks not of a bodily Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a Spiritual: otherwise it could not be called the first Resurrection; for there were more bodily Resurrections before St. <hi>Johns</hi> time, as the Resurrection of Christ; and many of the Saints: else the Apostle would never appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate blessednesse to those only that had part in the first Resurrection: as he doth, <hi>v.</hi> 6. which saying (if it were meant of the bodily Resurrection of the Martyrs before all other
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:30732:301"/> Saints) would exclude all the rest of the Saints from happynesse, who shall rise to life in the last day: yea the Scripture saith, that generally all the Saints shall rise in the last day; and who can exclude the Martyrs, from this rising? <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 28, 29. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 40. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 51, 52. How then shall I believe the Resurrection of an infinite number of Martyrs, before the last day?</p>
                              <p>And though it be said, the dead in Christ shall rise first, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 16. Yet 'tis not said, they shall rise a thousand years before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead, but the meaning is, the dead Saints shall rise, before the living Saints be changed; and 'tis spoken of all the Saints in general, not of the Martyrs only, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Shall not prevent them which are a sleep;</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                              <p> 2. To make all a little clearer, I will endeavour to give you the meaning of the whole passage, concerning the binding, and loosing of Satan, and the Reign of the Saints, during the time of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound, and the not-living of the rest of the dead, during the thousand years.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. 'Tis a prophecy of the peace of the Church for a long time, which time is called a thousand years; The Church shall flourish a long while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sorrows, and the rage of her Enemies shall be so checked, as if the Devil were bound in chains, v. 1, 2, 3.</p>

                              <p>Answer is made: That they fare better then the Saints on Earth; The Saints on Earth, only Reign on Earth: but the Saints departed Reign in Heaven with Christ during the space of that thousand years, and for ever and ever after, v. 4. compared with Chap. 22. 3, 4, 5.</p>
